In a fast-growing city, Glenrock State Conservation Area is a much-needed escape valve that is so near yet can feel so wonderfully remote.

From the Scout camp by Glenrock Lagoon to the mountain bike and walking trails through the bush, the conservation area plays many roles for Novocastrians and tourists. It is also a repository of history, from an Awabakal quarry to the ruins of coal mines. 

Yet some are concerned about Glenrock’s future, whether it will be over-used and over-loved.

In Saturday’s Weekender, features writer Scott Bevan explores Glenrock with those who work and play in the coastal park, to find out why this place is so special.
