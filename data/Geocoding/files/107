A US state has permanently revoked the medical licence of disgraced former sports doctor Larry Nassar.

The decision in Michigan would keep the doctor from practising if he ever got out of prison. Nassar is serving long prison sentences for molesting dozens of gymnasts and other girls and pleading guilty to having child pornography. In addition to permanently revoking his licence, the state Board of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery also fined Nassar one million US dollars, though it is doubtful he will be able to pay it. Attorney General spokeswoman Andrea Bitely said in a statement that it was unlikely Nassar will pay the fine, but the board sought to send a message. Her office sought the permanent revocation of Nassar’s licence after his licence was temporarily revoked last year.
