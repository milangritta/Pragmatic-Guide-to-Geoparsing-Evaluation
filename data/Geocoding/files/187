HE went from street busker to international superstar. On the way he embraced every genre of music from rock to folk, soul to R&B, and new wave to the Great American Song Book. Rod Stewart could have been summing up his own career when he sang Some Guys Have All The Luck. He is currently touring Canada and the US and kicks off his eighth year in residency at Caesar's Palace in June. But fans who can't make it to Las Vegas can enjoy the next best thing when a Rod Stewart tribute show comes to Clacton this weekend.

Paul Metcalfe stars in the lead role and takes the audience through Rod's incredible story, from humble beginnings through to worldwide superstardom and record sales of more than 200 million. His charismatic performance mirrors the persona of the legendary singer-songwriter from the distinctive vocals to the swaggering showmanship that has made Rod Stewart one of the most popular performers of all time. The first half of the show charts Rod's rise to fame, from his early days singing in the R 'n' B clubs of the Sixties through to worldwide success in the early Seventies. It features songs from the earlier part of Rod's career, including Handbags and Gladrags, In A Broken Dream, Stay With Me, Ooh La La and Wear It Well, and also includes an unplugged section. The second half captures all the excitement and energy of a Rod Stewart concert and is crammed full of hits such as Maggie May, Sailing, Baby Jane, Da Ya Think I'm Sexy, Tonight's The Night, The First Cut Is The Deepest and You're In My Heart. Paul swings his mic stand around, swaggers out into the audience and boots a volley of signed footballs into the crowd. The show includes all the massive hits from Rod’s career, with classic rockers like Baby Jane through to the big ballads, favourites from his days with the Faces such as Twistin' The Night Away, and timeless Motown tunes from the album Soulbook. Some Guys Have All The Luck is at the Princes Theatre on April 7 at 7.30pm.
