No fewer than 30 persons have been infected with measles at the Internally Displaced Peoples’ camp located in Abagana, an outskirts of Makurdi in Benue state. It was gathered that the victims of the disease are mostly women and children.

The Benue State Commissioner for Health and Human Services, Dr, Cecilia Ojabo, speaking to newsmen on the outbreak said some of those affected have been referred to hospitals in Makurdi town. She, however, insisted that her ministry would issue more details and facts of the disease later in the day. One of the victims, a nine-month old pregnant woman, Sarah Tyohem, who was displaced from her home in Torkula village of Guma Local Government Area of the state after gunmen attack on New Year Day, said she was already responding to treatment. Tyohem said measles broke out in the camp barely a week ago and had spread fast among those of them taking refuge there as she expressed gratitude to the medical team for quick responses.

In a similiar vein, two siblings, Mimidoo Tyowua, 11 and her brother, Aondona, 7, who were displaced from Umemger village of Guma LGA, were seen with symptoms of cough, redness of eyes and others. A camp official who pleaded anonymity said that at least four people have died of the ailment, in addition to the unhygienic situation of the overcrowded camp housing more than 35,000 people.
