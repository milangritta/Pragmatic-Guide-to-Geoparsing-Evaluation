The United States appreciates Morocco's role in the fight against terrorism and fundamentalism in many parts of the world, current United States House of Representatives Majority Whip, Steve Scalise, said Wednesday in Rabat. Speaking with Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives (Morocco’s lower house), Rachid El Abdi, Scalise, who is on a visit to Morocco at the head of a congress delegation, highlighted the longstanding and excellent relations between the two countries, recalling that Morocco was the first country to recognize the independence of the United States in 1777, a release issued by the House of Representatives said. For his part, El Abdi praised the "exceptional" relations binding the two countries and the two peoples and called for the strengthening of these relations in all areas, including at the parliamentary level. Noting that Morocco and the United States share the same values of peace, security and democracy, El Abdi underscored the importance of developing trade and investment between the two countries. He also informed the congress delegation of the latest developments of the Sahara issue, including the recent provocative movements of the Polisario, which are a violation of the ceasefire. This meeting was an opportunity to discuss the means to strengthen bilateral relations in various areas, in addition to other issues of common interest. MAP 05 April 2018
