By Talent Gondo | Harare’s Third Street will soon be renamed after the late Movement for Democratic Change founder and President, Morgan Richard Tsvangirai. Harare Mayor, Bernard Manyenyeni confirmed the development saying the renaming of Third street was a council resolution from yesterday’s full council meeting.

Manyenyeni however said, while council had endorsed the proposal, the process of renaming Third Street after Tsvangirai would have to go through cabinet. “Yes, council resolved to rename Third Street after the late Tsvangirai,” said Manyenyeni. He however said the resolution would soon be tabled before cabinet for approval before it is implemented.

“It has to go through cabinet and that is due process,” said Manyenyeni. Following the death of the opposition icon on February 14 2018, councillors within the MDC T dominated Harare City Council began tabling the proposal to name one of the streets in the central business district (CBD) after their late leader.

Tsvangirai, succumbed to colon cancer aged 65. The late opposition leader is credited for changing the face of Zimbabwean politics after winning against former President, Robert Mugabe in the 2008 harmonised elections. Rugare councillor, Peter Moyo moved the motion to have one of the roads named after Tsvangirai during a full council meeting in March 2018. Moyo argued that since the late opposition leader had not been accorded hero’s status by the Zanu Pf led government, there was need to rename one of the streets in the CBD after Tsvangirai as a way of honouring and remembering his contribution towards democracy in Zimbabwe.
