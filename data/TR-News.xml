        <text><![CDATA[A Turkish policeman fatally shot Russia’s ambassador to Turkey on Monday in front of a shocked gathering at a photo exhibit and then, pacing near the body of his victim, appeared to condemn Russia’s military role in Syria, shouting: “Don’t forget Aleppo! Don’t forget Syria!”
The leaders of Turkey and Russia said the attack in Ankara, the Turkish capital, was an attempt to disrupt efforts to repair ties between their countries, which have backed opposing sides in the Syrian civil war.
An Associated Press photographer and others at the art gallery watched in horror as the gunman, who was wearing a dark suit and tie, fired at least eight shots, at one point walking around Ambassador Andrei Karlov as he lay motionless and shooting him again at close range.
The assailant, who was identified as Mevlut Mert Altintas, a 22-year-old member of Ankara’s riot police squad, was later killed in a shootout with police. Three other people were wounded in the attack, authorities said.
The assassination came after days of protests by Turks angry over Russia’s support for President Bashar Assad in the Syrian conflict and Russia’s role in the bombardment and destruction of Aleppo, Syria’s largest city.
The gunman shouted about Aleppo in Turkish, and also yelled “Allahu akbar,” the Arabic phrase for “God is great,” continuing in Arabic: “We are the descendants of those who supported the Prophet Muhammad, for jihad.”
The attack, condemned by the White House and the United Nations, was another sign of how Turkey, a NATO member and a partner in the U.S.-led campaign against the Islamic State group, is struggling to contain multiple security threats. The war in Syria has been a major problem for years, sending several million refugees into Turkey and, more recently, drawing in Turkish troops.
Turkey has become accustomed to deadly attacks — Kurdish militants claimed responsibility for Dec. 10 bombings in Istanbul that killed 44 people, many of them police.
The spectacle of 62-year-old Karlov’s assassination by a member of the Turkish security forces at a photography exhibit meant to highlight Russian culture reinforced the sense of unease over the region’s conflict and complex web of alliances and relationships.
It came a day before a key meeting about Syria to be held in Moscow. Those attending include the foreign and defence ministers from Turkey, an opponent of Assad, and Russia and Iran, backers of the Syrian regime.
Russian President Vladimir Putin described the killing of Karlov as an attempt to damage Russia-Turkey ties “and to thwart a peace process in Syria which Russia, Turkey and Iran have been actively trying to promote.”
Putin said he and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed in a phone call that Russian investigators would fly to Ankara to conduct a joint probe with their Turkish counterparts.
“We must know who was directing the killer,” Putin said in televised remarks. He ordered top officials to strengthen protection of the Turkish Embassy in Moscow and asked Turkey to increase security at the Russian mission in Ankara.
In a video message shown on several Turkish TV channels, Erdogan said: “This is a provocation to damage the normalization process of Turkish-Russian relations. But both the Russian and Turkish administrations have the determination not to fall for this provocation.”
Karlov was several minutes into a speech at the embassy-sponsored exhibition in Ankara when he was gunned down.
Altintas, the gunman, also fired shots in the air, sending panicked audience members running for cover, and smashed several of the framed photos hung for the exhibition. The floor was splattered with blood, and the ambassador’s eye glasses lay a few feet from his body.
After shooting the ambassador, the gunman got into a 15-minute shootout with police before he was killed, Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency reported.
The shooter’s family home in the western province of Aydin was later searched and his mother, father and sister were detained, the news agency said, without citing sources. The man’s house in Ankara was raided and his roommate, also a police officer, was also taken into custody, it said.
Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said Altintas, who was born in 1994, had been an officer with Ankara’s riot police squad for more than two years. He did not give a motive for the attack.
“It’s a tragic day in the history of our country and Russian diplomacy,” Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.
“Ambassador Karlov has made a lot of personal contributions to the development of ties with Turkey. He has done a lot to overcome a crisis in bilateral relations,” she said. “He was a man who put his heart and his soul into his job. It’s a terrible loss for us and also the world.”
Karlov joined the diplomatic service in 1976. He served as Russia’s ambassador to Pyongyang from 2001-2006, and later worked as the chief of the Foreign Ministry’s consular department. He had served as the ambassador to Turkey since 2013.
The White House condemned the assassination, saying “this heinous attack on a member of the diplomatic corps is unacceptable,” President Barack Obama was briefed by his national security team while on vacation in Hawaii
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also condemned what he called a “senseless act of terror,” for which “there can be no justification.”
Relations between Russia and Turkey were badly strained by the downing of a Russian warplane at the Syrian border in November 2015, but Turkey’s apology earlier this year helped overcome the rift. Putin and Erdogan have held several meetings in recent months and spoken frequently over the phone.
Russia and Turkey have co-sponsored the evacuation of civilians and rebels from Aleppo and also discussed the prospect of organizing a new round of peace talks in Kazakhstan’s capital, Astana.
Security threats to Turkey include the Islamic State group, and which has been blamed for attacks in Turkey. Additionally, Turkish security forces and courts remain preoccupied with purging state institutions of the supporters of an exiled Islamist cleric whom the government accuses of staging a failed coup attempt in July.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[That's how Judy Law of Oxford, North Carolina, described her neighbors Jerome Faulkner, 73, and his wife, Dora, 62. The couple were found dead Thursday by West Virginia authorities, their bodies hidden under a mattress in a red Chevrolet truck after two police officers were shot and wounded at the scene.
"They kept to themselves, but when someone needed them, they were there," Law said of the Faulkners. "I can't even begin to understand why something like this happened."
The first sign of something amiss came Thursday morning, when Law woke to sirens and fire trucks congregating about 500 feet up the road at the Faulkners' home in Oxford.
Granville County Fire Marshal Doug Logan said the blaze was set intentionally, destroying the house. Video showed that it left little more than the home's front steps, its foundation and some scorched framing.
The county's sheriff, Brindell B. Wilkins Jr., told CNN affiliate WRAL that the Faulkners had been at home when two men came in, set their house ablaze and took off with the couple in their pickup truck. They'd be found dead hours later.
"(Jerome Faulkner) and his wife were good, fine people," said Logan. "They were the kind of people that would give you the shirts off their back.
"Why would anyone want to do this to them?"
West Virginia police shot at during traffic stop
More than 200 miles to the northwest, two police officers from the town of Lewisburg, West Virginia, pulled over a white Chevrolet SUV with North Carolina plates after learning it had been reported stolen.
As the officers were conducting the traffic stop on Interstate 64, a red Chevrolet truck pulled up alongside them, West Virginia State Police Lt. Michael Baylous said.
The driver of the truck then "pulled a handgun and shot at both officers," he said.
Group: Ambush attacks on officers increase
The drivers of both Chevrolets fled. The man behind the wheel of the red truck "went over the hillside and was eventually taken into custody," while the other motorist "drove behind a guardrail on the interstate and hid for a short amount of time," Baylous said.
"Eventually, he walked up to the interstate and turned himself in to law enforcement without incident," the State Police lieutenant added.
One of the suspects, 21-year-old Eric Campbell, was in the South Regional Jail in Beaver, West Virginia, on Friday, corrections Officer Jonathan Keller said. He is being held on two counts of malicious assault and two counts of attempted homicide, all charges related to the police shootout.
His father, Edward Campbell, is now in a West Virginia hospital but will face the same charges, according to Baylous. He said the pair are from Alvin, Texas, a Houston suburb some 1,200 miles from where they were found.
"We believe if the West Virginia police had not have stopped them that this crime spree would have continued on," said Wilkins, the Granville County sheriff. "And it's no telling from the investigation at this point what we're going to find."]]></text>

        <title>The transgender life: What to know, say and understand</title>
        <url>http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/01/us/transgender-questions-leelah/index.html</url>
        <domain>www.cnn.com</domain>
        <dltime>9:55 AM ET, Sun January 4, 2015</dltime>
        <text><![CDATA[Ohio sparked an intensely emotional reaction across social media which shows no sign of letting up. Born as Josh Alcorn, the teen signed an online suicide note as Leelah.
Leelah explained that she always felt like a girl and wanted her parents to accept that. They did not, mother Carla Alcorn told CNN, for religious reasons. Though she loved her child, the mother struggled to wrap her mind around what transgender means.
"The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren't treated the way I was, they're treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights," Leelah pleaded in her note. "My death needs to be counted."
There is more information than ever about transgender people -- from new research to a freshly written book of personal essays, "Trans Bodies, Trans Selves" to the critically acclaimed new Amazon series "Transparent."
What is transgender?
Transgender is an umbrella term for people whose gender identity, expression or behavior does not conform to the sex they were assigned at birth, according to American Psychological Association, which recently posted a Q&A on the topic. Sex is different from gender: Sex refers to genitalia, and gender is the cultural construct society has created to differentiate between men and women.
Transgender also gets confused with sexual orientation. Just because someone is transgender doesn't mean they are gay, lesbian or bisexual.
It's also important to know the difference between transgender people and transsexuals. Transsexuals alter or want to change their bodies by using hormones, surgery or other means to come more in line with the gender with which they associate, the association says. Not all transgender people want to change their bodies.
Although it may seem like a relatively new topic, transgender people have been documented since antiquity in many cultures around the world.
A transgender person has told you they are transgender. What's the first thing you should say?
Some experts say you should try this: "I love you and support you."
That first reaction from a friend or family member whose judgment matters is critical, said Aidan Key, the founder of the family education and support organization Gender Diversity in Washington. "Consider that they're facing many other challenges, and you can offer a place where they can simply be accepted, a place without struggle."
Chances are very good it's taken a tremendous amount of courage for your friend or family member to come to you.
Elizabeth Crankshaw, who was born a male but identifies as a woman, said it's also OK to "say you don't understand, because how could you? You'd have to be trans to get it."
Crankshaw grew up in the 1970s when there was no commonly parsed language about being transgender. She was married and came out first to her ex-wife and then to her sister.
"It was terrifying. I had so much anxiety," she recalled. "You have to think of the worst things that could happen. How will my employer will react? Will I lose my job? Will my co-workers treat me differently?"
If a transgender person is renting a home, she added, they could be afraid of backlash from a landlord.
If you feel the urge to ask a transgender person whether they've physically changed their genitalia, think twice.

        <title>Former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo dies at 82; we've 'lost a giant'</title>

        <text><![CDATA[Former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo -- who rose from the Depression-era streets of Queens to serve three times as governor and whose passionate keynote address at the 1984 Democratic political convention vaulted him onto the national political scene -- died Thursday. He was 82.

Cuomo had been hospitalized recently to treat a heart condition. His family said he passed away, at home, from "natural causes due to heart failure."
Cuomo was governor for three terms, from 1983 to 1995.
He was married to his wife, Matilda, for more than six decades. They had five children, including current New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who was sworn in for his second term Thursday, and Chris Cuomo, host of CNN's "New Day."
Asked once how he wanted to be remembered, Mario Cuomo replied: "One of the simple things I wanted to achieve is -- I want to be governor. I want to be the hardest working there ever was. And I want, when it's over -- and I figured on four years at first -- I want people to say, now, there was an honest person."Cuomo burst onto the national political stage with his keynote address at the 1984 Democratic National Convention.
To say he was a powerful speaker would be an understatement.
A Queens native, Cuomo was born in New York City, in the apartment above his father's grocery store. After a brief shot at a career in minor league baseball, he pursued a law degree and graduated at the top of his class at St. John's University School of Law.
Although the allure of public service was strong, Cuomo's early attempts at seeking political office ended in defeat.
His first electoral success came in 1978 as running mate to former Gov. Hugh Carey. Four years later, Carey stepped aside, and Cuomo entered the race and won.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Here's a look at Thanksgiving Day, celebrated in the United States on the fourth Thursday in November. In 2016, Thanksgiving is on November 24.Facts:
AAA forecasts 48.7 million Americans will travel 50 miles or more for Thanksgiving in 2016.
According to the USDA, 243 million turkeys are expected to be raised in the United States in 2016.
859 million pounds of cranberries are expected to be produced in the United States in 2016.

        <text><![CDATA[WASHINGTON Barack Obama pardoned his last turkey as U.S. president on Wednesday, but his daughters should beware: he plans to continue the tradition as a private citizen.
Obama, who leaves office in January, has followed the annual tradition of "pardoning" a turkey every year ahead of the Thanksgiving Day holiday, which many Americans celebrate with a turkey dinner.
His daughters, Malia and Sasha, often join their father for the tongue-in-cheek Rose Garden Ceremony.
Not this year.
"Of course, Thanksgiving is a family holiday as much as a national one. So for the past seven years, I've established another tradition: embarrassing my daughters with a corny-copia of Dad jokes about turkeys," Obama said.
"This year they had a scheduling conflict," he deadpanned.
The president was joined in the Rose Garden by his nephews instead. He joked that he planned to keep up the tradition during his post presidency.
After finishing his remarks, filled with puns, the president blessed a 40-pound (18-kg) fowl from Iowa, granting it a long life and a pardon from appearing on an American dinner table. A backup turkey also had its life spared. Their names: "Tot" and "Tater."]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[AUSTIN, Texas A white nationalist leader seen in a video shouting "Hail Trump" while some attendees perform Nazi salutes at a weekend rally in Washington is scheduled to speak at Texas A&M University next month for an event not sanctioned by the school, officials said on Wednesday.
Richard Spencer, leader of the National Policy Institute, was invited to speak by Preston Wiginton, a former student at the university, located in College Station, Texas, according to school newspaper The Battalion.
The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate speech, said Wiginton is a prominent white supremacist living part of the time in Russia.
Texas A&M said its leaders find Spencer's views in direct conflict with the university's core values.
"To be clear, Texas A&M University – including faculty, staff, students and/or student groups - did not invite this speaker to our campus nor do we endorse his rhetoric in any way," Amy Smith, the university's senior vice president and chief marketing and communications officer, said in a statement.
The National Policy Institute, a think tank within the so-called alt-right movement, which includes neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites, held a gathering at the federally owned Ronald Reagan Building last Saturday.
A video by The Atlantic taken inside the conference showed Spencer shouting, "Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!" as some of the people in attendance lifted their arms in a Nazi salute.
The alt-right movement came to the fore during the U.S. presidential election.
President-elect Donald Trump has drawn criticism for naming Steve Bannon, former head of Breitbart News, a website linked to the alt-right, as his chief White House strategist.

        <title>Ohio man gets 20 years prison for Islamic State-linked attack plot</title>

        <text><![CDATA[A southwest Ohio man who admitted to having plotted to execute a U.S. military base employee and then attack a local police station in support of Islamic State was sentenced on Wednesday to 20 years in prison, the U.S. Department of Justice said.
Munir Abdulkader, 22, from the Cincinnati suburb of West Chester, had pleaded guilty on March 24 to attempted murder of a government employee, attempted material support of a foreign terrorist organization and illegal firearm possession.
U.S. District Judge Michael Barrett in Cincinnati imposed the prison term, and ordered that Abdulkader remain under supervision for life.
Prosecutors had sought a 25-year prison term.
A federal public defender representing Abdulkader did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Abdulkader, who became a U.S. citizen in 2006 and had been a student at Xavier University, had begun by July 2014 expressing support for the Islamic State on Twitter, including a desire for martyrdom, according to prosecutors.
The defendant also communicated electronically with Junaid Hussain, an Islamic State member who encouraged him to conduct a violent attack in the United States, prosecutors said.
Hussain was a British hacker who U.S. and European officials had regarded as a top computer expert for Islamic State in Syria and a supporter of "lone wolf" attacks, before he was killed in an August 2015 U.S. drone strike.
Prosecutors said Abdulkader planned to murder the military official at home, videotape the killing so it could be used in Islamic State propaganda, and then use firearms and Molotov cocktails to attack a police station in the Cincinnati area.
Abdulkader was arrested on May 21, 2015, the same day he acquired an AK-47 assault rifle, court papers show.
The case is U.S. v. Abdulkader, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Ohio, No. 16-cr-00019.

        <title>U.S. offers mobile device guidelines to curb driver distraction</title>
        <url>http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-autos-safety-idUSKBN13I1E3</url>

        <dltime>Wed Nov 23, 2016 | 10:27am EST</dltime>
        <text><![CDATA[DETROIT The U.S. Transportation Department on Wednesday issued voluntary guidelines for makers of
            mobile devices, asking them to help keep eyes on the road by developing a "driver mode" that would disable
            some distracting functions in moving cars.
            The guidelines also ask manufacturers to make it easy to pair mobile devices with in-vehicle systems to
            facilitate hands-free phone use.
            “These common sense guidelines, grounded in the best research available, will help designers of mobile
            devices build products that cut down on distraction on the road," U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx
            said in a press statement.
            Mark Rosekind, administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said in statement on
            Wednesday that driver distraction was one of the factors behind the rise of traffic fatalities. Road deaths
            rose 10.4 percent in the first half of 2016, NHTSA has said.
            Phone calls, text messages, navigation systems and other features on cellphones can be dangerous
            distractions for drivers and the Transportation Department and NHTSA want to limit their functionality when
            the devices are in what is termed "driver mode."
            The Transportation Department also called for ease in pairing, which connects smart phones and cars to allow
            drivers to use voice control on the devices. Phone and vehicle pairing already are available for many new
            vehicles sold in the United States.
            Both the pairing and driver mode will reduce the potential for distraction by limiting the time a driver’s
            eyes are off the road, while also preserving the full functionality of the devices when used at other times.
            Major manufacturers of mobile devices used by American drivers include Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics.
            An auto manufacturers trade group earlier this month urged President-elect Donald Trump to establish a
            presidential advisory committee to "coordinate auto sector regulators." The Alliance of Automobile
            Manufacturers also called on Trump to conduct a "comprehensive regulatory review" of all regulations and
            actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration's new guidance on self-driving vehicles.]]></text>

        <title>'San Antonio Four' exonerated in 1990s Texas sexual assault cases</title>

        <text><![CDATA[A Texas court on Wednesday exonerated four women convicted of sexual assault in the 1990s after
            lawyers argued that they were sent to prison because of junk science, tainted testimony and false ideas of
            lesbian behavior.
            The Court of Criminal Appeals said the convictions of the so-called "San Antonio Four" for sexually
            assaulting two children, ages 7 and 9, did not pass "the smell test." With testimony recanted since the
            trial and new evidence, no reasonable juror could have found the women guilty, the court said.
            "Those defendants have won the right to proclaim to the citizens of Texas that they did not commit a crime,"
            the written ruling said. "They are innocent. And they are exonerated."
            Cassandra Rivera, Elizabeth Ramirez, Kristie Mayhugh and Anna Vasquez were sentenced to prison terms ranging
            from 15 to 37 years and each served more than a decade. They were released on bond a few years ago as the
            convictions began to unravel.
            "They are overjoyed at the decision. They will all be having great Thanksgivings," said Mike Ware an
            attorney with Innocence Project of Texas and the lead appellate counsel for the four.
            The four maintained their innocence and their supporters have slammed testimony presented by the state's
            star medical witness at trial, pediatrician Nancy Kellogg.
            Kellogg testified about what she said were physical injuries inflicted upon the girls as part of satanic
            rituals that she said were prevalent among some lesbians.Kellogg later retracted her testimony and agreed
            with defense claims that there were no signs of physical abuse, the appeals court said.]]></text>

        <title>US election recount: Jill Stein raises funds to examine Wisconsin result</title>

        <text><![CDATA[A former presidential candidate looks likely to spur a last-minute recount of part of the result
            of the US election.
            Donald Trump narrowly beat Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin, but two voting rights experts say the result needs
            to be more closely analysed.
            Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein says she has gathered enough money to fund a recount in
            Wisconsin.
            There is no indication Mr Trump's win was down to cyberhacking, one of the experts said on Wednesday.
            One election official in Wisconsin said they are preparing for a possible recount.
            What are the concerns?
            On Tuesday, New York magazine first reported that a group of experts, led by voting-rights lawyer John
            Bonifaz and J Alex Halderman, the director of the University of Michigan Center for Computer Security and
            Society, had contacted Mrs Clinton's campaign.
            The experts urged her campaign to request recounts in two states narrowly won by Mr Trump - Wisconsin and
            Pennsylvania - as well as Michigan, where he has a small lead.
            In a post on Medium on Wednesday, Mr Halderman repeated concerns he has voiced in the past over the
            vulnerabilities of paperless voting machines.]]></text>

        <title>Donald Trump calls for unity in Thanksgiving holiday address</title>

        <text><![CDATA[US President-elect Donald Trump has called for national unity in an address to mark the
            Thanksgiving holiday.
            In the wake of what he called a "long and bruising" election campaign he said emotions in the country were
            raw.
            The time had come, he said, "to begin to heal our divisions" but added that "tensions just don't heal
            overnight".
            His losing rival Hillary Clinton tweeted a picture of signs with supportive messages for her, which she said
            she found near her home.
            The messages included "We are thankful for Hillary - an American hero" and "You are loved". Mrs Clinton
            described them as "heartwarming".

            Earlier Mr Trump announced the appointment of two women to his cabinet, both of whom had been fiercely
            critical of him during the presidential campaign.
            In his Thanksgiving address, Mr Trump acknowledged the bitterness still remaining after the bruising
            election campaign: "It doesn't go quickly, unfortunately, but we have before us the chance now to make
            history together to bring real change to Washington, real safety to our cities, and real prosperity to our
            communities, including our inner cities."

            Image caption Nikki Haley: "A proven dealmaker," said Mr Trump
            On Wednesday, Mr Trump announced that South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley was his pick for US ambassador to
            the United Nations, while Betsy DeVos has been chosen to be secretary of education.
            Both are former critics of Mr Trump, with Mrs Haley once saying she was "not a fan", and Mrs DeVos branding
            the Manhattan tycoon an "interloper".
            The appointments will need to be approved by the Republican-controlled Senate.
            Mr Trump called Mrs Haley "a proven dealmaker, and we look to be making plenty of deals".
            "She will be a great leader representing us on the world stage," he added.
            Mrs Haley said she was "moved" to accept the assignment and would stay on as South Carolina governor,
            pending her congressional confirmation.
            During the Republican primaries, she supported Florida Senator Marco Rubio and then Texas Senator Ted Cruz.
            Mrs Haley also strongly attacked Mr Trump's proposal to ban Muslim immigrants, describing it as
            "un-American".]]></text>

        <title>Donald Trump calls Fidel Castro 'brutal dictator'</title>
        <url>http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-38118739</url>

        <text><![CDATA[Cuba's former leader Fidel Castro was a "brutal dictator", US President-elect Donald Trump has
            said, hours after the 90-year-old's death was announced.
            Mr Trump, who takes office in January, said he hoped Cubans could move towards a freer future.
            Castro came to power in 1959 and ushered in a Communist revolution. He defied the US for decades, surviving
            many assassination plots.
            Supporters said he returned Cuba to the people. Critics called him a dictator.
            His brother Raul, who succeeded him as president, announced his death on state television on Friday night.
            In a statement, Mr Trump said that while Cuba remained "a totalitarian island, it is my hope that today
            marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban
            people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve".
            The US cut ties with Cuba in 1961 amid rising Cold War tensions and imposed a strict economic embargo which
            remains in place more than half a century on.
            Under Barack Obama, the relationship warmed and diplomatic ties were restored in 2015.
            Mr Trump roundly criticised Mr Obama's policy on the campaign trail but made no mention of his pledge to
            reverse it in his statement, saying his administration would do all it could to ensure Cubans could "begin
            their journey toward prosperity and liberty".
            Mr Obama, meanwhile, said history would "record and judge the enormous impact" of Castro. America was
            extending "a hand of friendship to the Cuban people" at this time, he added.]]></text>

        <title>Trump dismisses Wisconsin recount drive as 'scam'</title>
        <url>http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38121264</url>

        <text><![CDATA[Republican President-elect Donald Trump has described an impending recount of votes in Wisconsin
            as a "scam".
            Mr Trump, who narrowly won the state, said the results "should be respected instead of being challenged or
            abused".
            Green Party candidate Jill Stein had initiated the recount. She also wants recounts in Michigan and
            Pennsylvania, citing "statistical anomalies".
            Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign has said it would participate in Wisconsin's recount.
            Results would need to be overturned in all three states to alter the outcome of the 8 November presidential
            election.
            Is US system a 'disaster for democracy'?
            Why US fears Russia is hacking election
            US election results
            In a statement released by his transition team on Saturday, Mr Trump accused Dr Stein of trying to "fill her
            coffers with money" on the pretext of asking for donations towards a recount.
            "The people have spoken and the election is over," the statement said.
            Dr Stein defended her recount initiative, telling CNN that "the point to drive home here is that having a
            secure elections process benefits us all".
            She also suggested that she was open to looking at recounts in other states - not just Wisconsin, Michigan
            and Pennsylvania.]]></text>

        <title>Abducted California woman Sherri Papini found after three weeks</title>

        <text><![CDATA[A missing California mother of two has been found three weeks after she was abducted while out
            jogging.
            Sherri Papini was still bound with restraints when she managed to flag down a car on Thursday some 140 miles
            (225km) from where she was last seen.
            Police, who say she was released by her captors, are looking for two women in connection with her
            disappearance.
            Ms Papini's husband had reported her missing after she failed to pick up their children from day care.
            The motive behind her abduction in Redding, northern California, on 2 November, is still unclear.
            County Sheriff Tom Bosenko told reporters Ms Papini was receiving medical attention for non-life threatening
            injuries at a nearby hospital.
            "We are very thankful on this day [Thanksgiving] that she was found safe and reunited with her family.''
            A $50,000 (£40,200) reward is being offered to find those responsible for Ms Papini's capture.
            Investigators had interviewed hundreds of local residents regarding her disappearance and received some 400
            tips.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Mason charged with sex assault. BANTAM — A Danbury stonework mason was arraigned in Bantam Superior Court Tuesday on charges he sexually assaulted a 10-year-old girl over six years ago. Rafael Gomez, 27, 69 Wooster St., stood before Judge Corinne Klatt for his first court appearance in a case that first came to the attention of the New Milford Police Department in July 2002. Gomez, a native of Mexico, was arrested by Danbury police on Monday night and brought to New Milford
        authorities, where he was charged with first-degree sexual assault and two counts of risk of injury to a minor.
         Gomez is prohibited from having any contact with the alleged victim, the judge ordered. He is scheduled to appear
         in Litchfield Superior Court on April 7.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Bingham to offer plan to combat drugs.
        TORRINGTON — Mayor Ryan Bingham is scheduled to hold a press conference at
        noon today to unveil a new program regarding drugs being sold in the city.
        The press conference well be held at the Cumberland Farms gas station at 207 South
        Main St.Bingham will announced a new program for Torrington businesses that voluntarily
        remove items from their shelves that can be used for drug use. Bingham specified a novelty item
        known as a “love rose.” In recent weeks, the mayor announced he would hold this press conference,
         noting that the selling of drug paraphernalia is a problem in city stores. The Cumberland Farms,
          where the mayor will announce his program, has agreed to be the city’s first partner in the new initiative, Bingham said.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[MLA Sandra Jansen made an impassioned plea to her colleagues in the Alberta legislature on
            Tuesday, asking them to stand up against hate speech levelled at women in politics. (CBC)
            Warning: This story contains foul language some readers will find offensive.
            Calgary MLA Sandra Jansen drew a standing ovation Tuesday after she rose in the legislature and gave an
            impassioned speech denouncing the hateful and misogynistic comments she has faced since crossing the floor
            to join the NDP last week.
            The first words out of the former Tory MLA's mouth likely raised eyebrows when she said: "What a traitorous
            bitch!"
            The Calgary-North West MLA, first elected in 2012, has faced abuse and threats since she crossed the floor
            to join the government last week, and has since been assigned a temporary protection unit to accompany her,
            a spokesman for the premier's office told CBC News.
            In her statement, Jansen went on to read a litany of demeaning and despicable comments she has faced on
            Twitter and Facebook.
            "You are both a disgrace to Alberta."
            "Lying bitches."
            "Now you have two blond bimbos in a party that is clueless."
            "Another useless tit goes NDP."
            "Dead meat."
            "Sandra should stay in the kitchen, where she belongs."
            "Fly with the crows and get shot."
            "Dumb broad. A good place for her to be is with the rest of the queers."
            Her point made and the house apparently shocked into silence, Jansen then made a plea to her colleagues in
            all parties to stand up against hate speech levelled at women in politics.
            'If we don't feed it, we must oppose it'
            "If you are stunned by the words you have heard in the last few days," Jansen said to MLAs in the
            legislature, "if you reject the inherent violence behind them, and you know that harassment and abuse, even
            if it's verbal, even if it's online, and even if it's directed at a political opponent, is poison. Let us be
            strong and clear in our resolve that no matter where we sit along political lines, we stand together against
            this.
            Jansen then said: "If we don't feed it, we must oppose it. Please oppose it. Don't ignore it. Don't look the
            other way. Don't excuse it. Because our daughters are watching us."
            Girls and young women see the challenges faced by women in politics, Jansen said, and they often hear the
            abuse levelled at them.
            "Imagine if we let that poison become normalized?" Jansen asked. "Or if our daughters forego the political
            arena altogether. That scares me."
            Her member's statement concluded, Jansen then sat down while the rest of the MLAs got to their feet and
            applauded for more than 20 seconds.
            Jansen crossed the floor to join the NDP last week, nine days after she dropped out of the PC leadership
            race.
            She quit the race after alleging she was harassed and intimidated by volunteers from another candidate's
            campaign during a weekend PC meeting in Red Deer. Donna Kennedy-Glans dropped out of the leadership race on
            the same day, leaving four men as the only contenders to lead the party that was swept from power by the NDP
            in May 2015.]]></text>

        <title>US hacking claims: Obama told Putin to 'cut it out'</title>
        <domain>www.bbc.com</domain>
        <url>http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38349989</url>
        <dltime>17 December 2016</dltime>
        <text><![CDATA[President Barack Obama has said that he ordered Russia's Vladimir Putin to "cut it out" in a conversation about email hacking ahead of the US election.
Implying that the Russian president knew about the hacks, Mr Obama said: "Not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin."
The president said he had warned Mr Putin of serious consequences at a summit in September.
A month later, the US accused Russia of meddling in its democratic process.
The president has promised a "proportional" response to the hacking of the Democratic Party and of emails belonging to defeated presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman.
He appeared to suggest that the US could go on the offensive with its own cyber muscle, stating: "Whatever they do to us, we can potentially do to them."
Mr Obama's comments came during his last news conference of the year.
The president did not criticise his successor, Republican Donald Trump, by name, but said some Republicans were failing to acknowledge the seriousness of Russia's involvement in the US election.
He also expressed bewilderment over GOP supporters who say they approve of Mr Putin, declaring: "Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave."
The president urged Mr Trump to back a bipartisan investigation into Russian cyber intrusions.
Earlier this week, Donald Trump poured scorn on US intelligence claims that Russian hackers helped swing the election in his favour, calling them ridiculous and politically-motivated.
He tweeted: "Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory!"
CIA Director John Brennan told employees on 16 December that the FBI agrees with the CIA's conclusion that Russia's goal was to help Mr Trump win.
The Kremlin denies US claims that Russia hacked official emails, and has called them "indecent".
"They need to either stop talking about this or finally present some sort of proof," Mr Putin's spokesman said.
Putin's 'personal beef'
The Kremlin's response came as Mrs Clinton attributed her election defeat to Russian hacking for the first time.
She told party donors that President Putin had a "personal beef" against her for describing Russia's parliamentary elections five years ago as rigged.
She also cited the release of a letter by FBI director James Comey as having lost her close races in key states.
Mr Comey made headlines when he announced a new inquiry into Mrs Clinton's email server 11 days before the presidential election. The matter was dropped two days before Americans voted.
The FBI had previously concluded that Mrs Clinton had been "extremely careless" over her use of a private email server while secretary of state, but there were no grounds for any charges.
The New York Times said Mrs Clinton's comments were her first on the subject since widespread reports of the hacking surfaced before the election.
"Putin publicly blamed me for the outpouring of outrage by his own people, and that is the direct line between what he said back then and what he did in this election," Mrs Clinton said, quoted by the Times.
"This is not just an attack on me and my campaign, although that may have added fuel to it. This is an attack against our country. We are well beyond normal political concerns here. This is about the integrity of our democracy and the security of our nation."]]></text>

        <title>Nine die in Vancouver in 24 hours from fentanyl opioid overdose</title>
        <url>http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38351958</url>
        <domain>www.bbc.com</domain>
        <dltime>17 December 2016</dltime>
        <text><![CDATA[Nine people have died in Vancouver in the past 24 hours from an overdose of the painkiller fentanyl
            opioid, officials say.
            Mayor Gregor Robertson said these were "desperate times" for the Canadian city, adding that more deaths were
            expected.
            "It's hard to see any silver lining right now when we haven't hit rock bottom," Mr Robertson said.
            Drug abuse in Canada claimed the lives of 2,000 people in 2015.
            The government has invested tens of millions of dollars in public health emergency responses in recent
            years, but Mr Robertson said that more was needed.
            Police Chief Adam Palmer also called for more help for the city's addicts. "Can you imagine nine people
            dying from another cause in one day in our city?" he said.
            Vancouver has seen an average of 15 drug overdoses a month, with dozens more deaths still under
            investigation, Mr Palmer said.
            The city's coroner said that morgues had reached capacity.
            Most of the deaths occurred in the Downtown Eastside neighbourhood, where drugs can be easily bought, Mr
            Palmer said.
            Two milligrams of pure fentanyl, the size of about four grains of salt, is enough to kill an average adult.
            In April, the US singer Prince died of an accidental overdose of the dangerously powerful synthetic drug.
            What is fentanyl?
            Fentanyl is an extremely strong painkiller, prescribed for severe chronic pain, or breakthrough pain which
            doesn't respond to regular painkillers.
            It is an opioid painkiller which means it works by mimicking the body's natural painkillers, called
            endorphins, which block pain messages to the brain.
            It can cause dangerous side effects, including severe breathing problems.
            The risk of harm is higher if the wrong dose or strength is used.]]></text>

        <title>Flights disrupted as fog descends on London's airports</title>

        <text><![CDATA[Fog has affected travel in southern England with some flights cancelled due to poor visibility at London
            airports.
            London City airport diverted all inbound flights on Saturday while Heathrow and Gatwick also reported
            disruption.
            Passengers were told to expect delays and to contact their airline before travelling to the airport.
            There will be further disruption for travellers over Christmas because of industrial action over pay
            disputes.
            The poor visibility in south-east England caused at least a dozen British Airways flights to be cancelled.
            "In common with other airlines, we are experiencing some disruption to our flights," a BA spokesperson said.
            BA warned that there would be knock-on delays due to disruption at Heathrow. It said to expect delays and a
            "small number" of cancellations, as the airport has restricted landing and take-off.
            On Friday, BA cabin crew based at Heathrow said they would strike on Christmas Day and Boxing Day in a row
            over pay and conditions.
            Christmas 2016 travel: When should I avoid the roads?
            Are we facing a Christmas of Discontent?
            Source: Civil Aviation Authority
            London City airport told passengers that "significant fog in London is continuing to cause flight delays"
            and that it was closing from around midday on Saturday until Sunday.
            The Met Office warned of cloudy weather throughout Saturday evening in London, with areas of mist and fog
            becoming widespread.
            Sunday will "start on a grey and murky note with patchy fog persisting", a statement added.
            Other parts of the country also experienced reduced visibility on Saturday.
            The disruption to flights comes days before a planned 48-hour strike at UK airports called by the Unite
            union over pay and conditions.
            More than 1,500 check-in staff, baggage handlers and cargo crew employed by Swissport will walk out on 23
            December.
            It is unclear exactly how many airports will be affected, but airlines at Edinburgh, Aberdeen airports all
            employ Swissport staff.
            Swissport said it had made numerous offers to Unite since April 2015 to resolve the dispute. It said the
            planned strike was "another in a series of recent examples where a minority of trade union members are
            acting in a cynical fashion".
            The company said it would do "everything within its power to limit any impact of the proposed industrial
            action on the airlines it serves and their passengers".
            Virgin Atlantic pilots have voted to work to rule from 23 December in a row over union recognition.]]></text>

        <title>Uber defies demand to cease self-driving</title>
        <url>http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-38349800</url>
        <domain>www.bbc.com</domain>
        <dltime>17 December 2016</dltime>
        <text><![CDATA[Uber has been told its self-driving cars are illegal - but it is refusing to take them off San Francisco's
            roads.
            The company started testing the vehicles this week, but the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) has said the
            firm must have a test permit.
            Uber said it did not need one as they have a safety driver at the wheel, and is going to ignore the demand.
            California's attorney general - the state's most senior government lawyer - said Uber must cease the driving
            immediately or face further action.
            A spokeswoman for the attorney general's office would not be drawn on what the specific action could be, but
            the next step would likely be a court order compelling Uber to carry out the demand.
            'Illegal'
            Other companies testing autonomous technology in California, such as Google, have applied for and obtained
            the permit which costs $150 (£120) for 10 vehicles.
            Additional vehicles can be added at a rate of $50 for each additional 10 vehicles.
            "It is illegal for the company to operate its self-driving vehicles on public roads until it receives an
            autonomous vehicle testing permit," said Brian Soublet from the California DMV in a letter to Uber this
            week.
            In a conference call with media on Friday, Uber's vice-president of Advanced Technologies Anthony
            Levandowski said Uber had "respect" for officials, but that the regulations were irrelevant to its cars.
            "You don't need a belt and suspenders if you're wearing a dress," he told reporters.
            In his view the permit only applies to cars that could operate "without the active physical control or
            monitoring of a human operator".
            Uber's cars need a human, he said - although the company still intends to refer to the vehicles as
            "self-driving cars".
            He went on to make a comparison with electric car company Tesla. Its cars come with a feature known as
            Autopilot which takes control of the vehicle and automatically keeps up with traffic and changes lanes.
            Autopilot does not require a permit, and so Uber argued its cars should be treated the same way. It
            requested clarification from the DMV on that issue specifically.
            Google cars have a human driver behind the wheel at all times.
            The permit requires companies to cover insurance costs as well as provide public reports on any collisions
            or instances when the human driver must take control.
            Uber said it planned to make disclosures about the performance of its cars, but did not specify how.
            On Friday afternoon, a number of the cars were seen travelling around the city.
            Earlier in the week one of the cars was filmed jumping a red light, an incident Uber blamed on human error.]]></text>

        <title>Turkish bus attack: 13 off-duty soldiers killed by car bomb</title>

        <text><![CDATA[A suicide car bomb in central Turkey has killed 13 soldiers aboard a bus and wounded 56 more, officials
            say.
            The blast destroyed the bus carrying soldiers visiting a local market in the city of Kayseri. An army
            spokesman said civilians may also have been injured.
            No group has admitted carrying out the attack, but Turkish officials say it bears the hallmarks of the
            outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
            It comes a week after 44 people were killed in a PKK attack in Istanbul.
            Regional governor Suleyman Kamci said the blast in Kayseri, a usually calm industrial hub in Central
            Anatolia, was carried out by a suicide bomber parked next to the bus near the entrance to Erciyes
            University. The soldiers were said to be on leave from a nearby military base.
            Seven people have been arrested in connection with the blast
            Images from the scene showed the bus reduced to a smouldering wreck with a massive hole punched in one side.
            Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said the materials used were similar to those used in
            Istanbul.
            "All indications at present point to the PKK," he said.
            President Tayyip Erdogan said that Kurdish militants were attempting to "trip up Turkey, cut its strength
            and have it focus its energy and forces elsewhere".
            Turkey has suffered a series of fatal bombings in 2016 at the hands of both the Kurdish militants and
            jihadists.]]></text>

        <title>German-Iraqi boy, 12, 'tried to bomb Christmas market'</title>
        <url>http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38343124</url>

        <text><![CDATA[A 12-year-old German-Iraqi boy tried to blow up a Christmas market in the town of Ludwigshafen, prosecutors say.
He left a rucksack with explosives which failed to detonate in November, and put another explosive device by the town hall a few days later, they say.
But a member of the public alerted the police, and no-one was injured.
The 12 year old - who is now in custody - is thought have been recently radicalised and to have links with the so-called Islamic State group.
Focus magazine cited security and judicial sources as saying the boy was "strongly radicalised" and apparently instructed by an unknown IS member.
The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office declined to comment on a possible IS link, but confirmed officials were investigating the case.
Public Prosecutor Hubert Stroeber said the boy left a backpack containing a home-made nail bomb at the Christmas market in Ludwigshafen, in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, on 26 November, but the device did not go off because the detonator apparently failed.
The second device near the city's town hall, placed on 5 December, was discovered by an "informant" and specialists defused it, Mr Stroeber said.
The boy was born in Ludwigshafen to Iraqi parents in 2004.
Prosecutors said no formal proceedings would be launched against him, because he is below the age of criminal responsibility.
Last Thursday, German police arrested two teenagers aged 15 and 17, accused of plotting a terror attack on a public institution in Aschaffenburg, in north-western Bavaria. Police found Islamic State flags and propaganda material in their homes.
Germany suffered a spate of attacks in the south of the country over the summer.
Ten people were killed and dozens more injured in separate gun, bomb, axe and machete attacks.
The authorities say they were not linked, and one of them was not terror-related.
But the wave of violence has made a nation already on edge after a huge influx of refugees even more nervous.]]></text>

        <title>Rome mayor Virginia Raggi's right-hand man' Raffaele Marra arrested</title>

        <text><![CDATA[A top aide of Rome's new mayor has been arrested on suspicion of corruption, months after the politician was
            elected promising to clean up local government.
            Raffaele Marra was arrested on Friday, as part of an investigation of business deals dating from 2013.
            Mr Marra is the head of personnel in city hall and is considered Mayor Virginia Raggi's right-hand man.
            Ms Raggi is the populist Five-Star Movement's highest profile elected representative.
            The party prides itself on being ethical and having no links to what it sees as a "caste" of sleaze-addicted
            cronies it says have dominated Italian politics for decades.
            But Mr Marra's arrest comes days after Ms Raggi's top environmental adviser resigned following the
            revelation she was under investigation.
            The two investigations, which are not linked, will put pressure on Ms Raggi, whose success is seen as
            crucial for the Five-Star Movement ahead of national elections.
            Mr Marra's case is not linked to any council activity, but offices at the city hall were raided.]]></text>

        <title>Spanish university head accused of copy-paste plagiarism</title>

        <text><![CDATA[The chancellor of a Spanish university where students were told their work would be monitored for
            plagiarism has himself been accused of plagiarising.
            Fernando Suarez, who heads the King Juan Carlos University in Madrid, is accused of repeatedly copying other
            people's work without giving credit.
            On Thursday, he was removed from his chairmanship on a national education commission.
            Mr Suarez has said he is the victim of defamation and harassment.
            The permanent commission of the conference of Spanish university chancellors said on Thursday that Mr Suarez
            was leaving due to "information published about presumed plagiarism".
            He has been accused of copying other historians' work and that of his students, over a period of up to 10
            years.
            'Indignant'
            One article published under his name was said to consist of 70% copied-and-pasted words from another
            person's book.
            The French historian Bernard Vincent told the AFP news agency Mr Suarez had borrowed paragraphs from his
            work, describing it as "scandalous".
            He said: "I'm absolutely indignant."
            Last month, the university Mr Suarez heads had informed students that the campus had installed a system
            called Unplag to monitor submitted assignments for plagiarism.
            An email sent to 40,000 students stated that the new programme would help uphold standards of integrity,
            academic honesty and independent thinking.
            Students have set up at least nine separate petitions calling for Mr Suarez to resign from the top job at
            the university. Together they have collected tens of thousands of signatures.
            One pointed out: "Plagiarism is grounds for any student to be suspended immediately."]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Nine movies have been put forward for the next stage of the contest for best foreign-language film at the Oscars.
            They include the Golden Globe-nominated Toni Erdmann from Germany and The Salesman from Iran.
            But there is no place for French thriller Elle, starring Isabelle Huppert, who has herself been tipped for a
            best actress Oscar nomination.
            The nine films will be whittled down to five when the Academy Award nominations are announced on 24 January.
            Other films in the running include Australia's Tanna, which is set in the South Pacific and filmed in the
            Navhal and Nafe languages. It won the audience award at the Venice International Film Festival.
            Xavier Dolan's Canadian drama It's Only the End of the World, which won the Cannes Grand Prix prize, has
            also made the list.
            Other notable omissions include Chile's Neruda, starring Gael Garcia Bernal, and Julieta, by Spanish
            director Pedro Almodovar.
            The full list of movies in contention for best foreign language film:
            The Academy Awards takes place on 26 February at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, with Jimmy Kimmel as host.]]></text>

        <title>French and Spanish police arrest five over 'Basque Eta arms cache'</title>

        <text><![CDATA[Mr Tubiana, honorary president of the Human Rights League of France, said he had initially intended to be
            with the activist group, but did not attend the meeting.
            "We didn't hide, our plans were clear from the start," he told French media.
            "There is a total blockage in the Eta disarmament process, a blockage which comes from the French and
            Spanish governments' side. Several civil society members wanted to re-launch the process, by carrying out a
            first destruction of weapons."
            He added: "This police operation is clearly political."
            Sources close to the case said those arrested were to be transferred to Paris to be questioned by
            anti-terror prosecutors.
            French Interior Minister Bruno Le Roux said on Saturday that "nobody has the right to proclaim themselves a
            destroyer of arms".
            He said in an earlier statement that the arrests were "the result of excellent co-operation" with Spanish
            authorities and "a new blow to Eta".
            The Spanish government has refused to negotiate with Eta. In 2014 the group said it had put some of its
            weapons "beyond use" but the government dismissed the statement as "theatrical".
            Eta was formed more than 50 years ago in the era of Spanish dictator General Franco to fight for an
            independent Basque homeland.
            It killed more than 800 people over four decades of violence.]]></text>

        <title>Instagram fixes Singapore viral 'bug'</title>

        <dltime>16 December 2016</dltime>
        <text><![CDATA[Instagram said it had fixed a "bug" that saw users geo-tag themselves as being in Singapore in a bid to go viral - even though they were not there.
            Some users claimed the apparent hack increased the chances of a post reaching the coveted Explore page on
            the photo-sharing app.
            Posts in that section are likely to get many more likes and attract followers.
            Instagram confirmed to the BBC that it was a "bug that impacted engagement" when posts were tagged with
            Singapore.
            Like on Facebook, what appears on your Instagram is based on the firm's algorithm. The spokesperson added
            that they have now fixed the issue.
            The trend started when dozens of prominent "influencers" were seen tagging their Instagram photos with the
            location "Singapore, Singapore", despite being nowhere near the South East Asian city-state.
            In a technology feature published earlier this week, Tech Mic reported that the trick caught on with
            internet stars like King Bach and Christian Collins, who began geo-tagging their posts to gain wider reach.]]>

        <title>In Shadow of Amazon, European Challenger Looks to China for Inspiration</title>
        <url>https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/16/technology/amazon-zalando-eu-online-shopping.html</url>
        <domain>www.nytimes.com</domain>

        <text><![CDATA[BERLIN — Robert Gentz stepped off an Air Berlin plane in Beijing with the goal
            of conquering online fashion in China. By the time he boarded his return flight to Berlin, he had a new
            plan: to copy it.
            Mr. Gentz, a 34-year-old German who is a co-founder of Zalando — a European clone of Zappos,
            the online American shoes and fashion retailer owned by Amazon — held meetings in the fall of
            2013 with Chinese and international fashion labels, online stores and other parts of the local e-commerce
            industry. He wanted to expand his company into the world’s largest digital market.
            But after the meetings, Mr. Gentz decided China’s approach to online fashion was far ahead of anything
            available elsewhere.
            He marveled at how Chinese consumers freely chatted with — and bought from — brands and stylists on WeChat, a local internet messenger, while online retailers, independent delivery companies and fashion houses routinely joined forces.
            “We wanted to take that experience back to Europe,” Mr. Gentz said.
            This holiday season, Zalando, which is Europe’s biggest digital fashion player, is using a made-in-China
            approach to take on Amazon, just as the American giant is looking to cement its place as the world’s dominant e-commerce company by expanding aggressively into the Continent’s still-fragmented world of digital fashion.]]>

        <text><![CDATA[Winter is making its presence known across Canada this weekend, with many areas of the country under extreme cold or snowfall warnings.
            In B.C., up to 20 centimetres of snow is expected for parts of the Central Coast in the coming days, with 10 to 15 centimetres expected along much of the south West Coast and inland areas.
            Homeless advocates all over the province urged officials to provide more help, from blankets to warming shelters.
            And cold temperatures have frozen ponds and lakes in the Vancouver area that have not seen skaters in years.
            Poor conditions caused over 200 flights to be cancelled at Toronto's Pearson International Airport, while Ottawa's Macdonald-Cartier International Airport had 41 delays and cancellations and Montreal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport had 88.
            Environment Canada now says snowfall in Toronto has "tapered off to light and intermittent," but warns of freezing drizzle or ice pellets into the night. Drivers in the city are also being warned of poor road conditions as ice could build up due to the mix of precipitation.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[The man known as Canada's "Prince of Pot" says he's "feeling good" after spending a night in a Montreal
            jail.
            Marc Emery, who operates an illegal chain of marijuana shops under the name of "Cannabis Culture," was
            arrested along with nine others on Friday evening during a series of raids by Montreal police.
            Police were targeting six new Cannabis Culture locations that had just opened the day before.
            Emery, who was working at the store on Mont-Royal Avenue, is now charged with drug trafficking, possession
            for the purpose of trafficking and conspiracy.
            Emery was released after posting a $5,000 bond and is prohibited from consuming cannabis, entering places
            that produce or sell cannabis, or communicating with anyone linked to Cannabis Culture operations in Montreal.
            Speaking to reporters after his release on Saturday, Emery said he is not allowed to stay in Quebec and can
            only return if it is for a court date.
            It's unclear if the stores will reopen, he added, because he cannot be in the province and authorities are
            pressuring the landlords to keep the locations closed.
            On Saturday, Montreal police officers were seen checking the properties to ensure that they were not in
            operation.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[It may be mild out now but prepare for a flash freeze making for slick and slippery driving conditions
            lasting through to Sunday morning.
            A messy mix of freezing drizzle, ice pellets and light snow is expected to descend on Toronto Saturday
            night, Environment Canada warns.
            After a generous dumping of snow Friday night, temperatures climbed up to just above the freezing mark
            Saturday, turning the white stuff to slush in many parts of the city. But the warm up will end in the early
            hours of Sunday morning as the mercury falls to as low as -14 C with a wind chill of -21.
            Salt trucks have been deployed on main roads in Etobicoke, the city said in a tweet and crews expect to
            complete their first round of plowing on sidewalks by 12 a.m.  A second round begins at 2 a.m. and will
            continue throughout Sunday.
            The city is also urging residents not to shovel snow onto roads both to avoid endangering motorists and
            cyclists, and so as not to hamper snow-clearing operations.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[A 23-year-old man is in a Winnipeg jail on human trafficking charges after police allege he held a woman
            against her will and forced her to work as an escort at various Winnipeg hotels.
            "She had been driven to Winnipeg from Montreal on Dec. 4 ... for this sole purpose," police wrote in a
            news release, adding she was threatened if she failed to comply.
            On Friday evening, city police were called to check on the well-being of a 23-year-old woman at a downtown
            hotel. She and the male suspect are both from Quebec.
            Winnipeg police Const. Jason Michalyshen said police made the arrest after hearing from the woman's family,
            who were concerned about her.
            He said the suspect allegedly assaulted the woman with a weapon while he was in control of her.
            "We were just thankful that we were able to respond quickly," Michalyshen said.
            A 19-year-old woman was also found with the 23-year-old woman and the man. She claimed to be his girlfriend.
            The man is charged with trafficking in persons, advertising sexual services and assault with a weapon.
            Alaya McIvor is a survivor of sex trafficking and now works with victims at Sage House, a street women's
            health and outreach centre.
            She was trafficked seven years ago across Canada and said the crime continues regularly in Winnipeg.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is warning people not to eat a frozen chicken and fried rice product recalled by Costco Canada for the second time this year.
            According to the CFIA, there is a risk that the chicken in the ready-to-eat product is undercooked.
            It said the recall was triggered by one in another country.
            The recalled products have best before dates between Sept. 26, 2017, and Nov. 5, 2017. Their product code is
            0-71757-05642-8.
            The CFIA said people should throw out the product or return it to the store where they purchased it.
            The agency had not received any reports of people getting sick from the chicken and fried rice meal.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[They call her their "miracle baby."
She's 9 months old now, but when Lucy Lau was born in Churchill, Man. her parents didn't know if she would live. That's because she was born prematurely, just 23 weeks into her mother's pregnancy.
"The first thing I did was actually come to terms with the fact that we might lose our daughter," recalled Lucy's father Ian Lau, a Churchill doctor.
"I was in shock," added Ian's wife Cynthia, another doctor, recalling going into labour.
Ian Lau said Lucy is the smallest newborn he's ever seen.
"We were shocked at how tiny she was," he said.
"She was not moving, she was purple and she was not breathing."
Ian and his wife said they knew their daughter's chances of survival were small.
Babies as premature as Lucy cannot breathe on their own, and require the assistance of a special ventilator to survive.
Ian said the couple felt hopeless for a moment and said a prayer for their daughter.
He offered doctors at the hospital in Churchill help and inserted a breathing tube into Lucy's windpipe to get her breathing started.
"You can imagine trying to inflate a balloon. It's always that first breath of air that's the hardest to get in there," he said.
'She weighed so little'
After being born, Lucy had to be rushed by air ambulance from Churchill to the Children's Hospital of Manitoba in Winnipeg.
But first, her parents held her. "I could feel her little arms and legs moving around and she was just very gently stroking me, my skin," said Cynthia.
"All I could feel was the blankets that were surrounding her because she weighed so little," added Ian.
The Children's Hospital Foundation of Manitoba has put out a call for donations to help pay for new jet ventilators, like the one used to save Lucy's life.
In April, the hospital had to rent jet ventilators because they didn't have enough.
Tanya Williams, a spokesperson for the foundation, says the hospital sees 30 to 40 infants who require the equipment every year in the intensive care unit. She said the machines cost $45,000 US each.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Toronto resident Sarah Vermelhudo cared deeply for her godson Shayne MacDonald, the 21-year-old nephew she hung out with "all the time."
            "She never had any children of her own, so she treated Shayne like she was his mom, almost," recalled
            Vermelhudo's cousin, Jenny Palma, a salon owner in Toronto.
            Now, Palma and other family members are trying to comprehend a shocking turn of events:
            38-year-old Vermelhudo is dead after being stabbed on Friday. MacDonald is now the subject of a Canada-wide
            warrant and faces charges of second-degree and attempted murder.
            "She had a heart of gold," Palma said in an emotional phone call with CBC Toronto. "This was really
            unbelievable."
            Police say the attempted murder charge is in connection with the stabbing of Vermelhudo's 59-year-old
            mother, Maria Vermelhudo.
            MacDonald was a staple in Sarah Vermelhudo's life, Palma said, and it's not yet clear what happened on
            Friday night while the two were spending
            time together at the Little Portugal home Vermelhudo shared with her mother.
            Det.-Sgt. Graham Gibson of the Toronto police homicide squad said police believe MacDonald went to the house
            on College Street near Dufferin Street around 8 p.m.
            During the visit, family members on the main floor heard screaming and a struggle happening upstairs.
            Gibson said Vermelhudo came downstairs, suffering from stab wounds. Family members tried to help, including
            her mother, who was injured as well.
            Both women were taken to St. Michael's Hospital, and while Maria was treated and released, Vermelhudo died
            from her wounds. Her body was scheduled to undergo a postmortem examination on Saturday.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Claire Lavallee's kids will get a Christmas after all.
            The single mom feared she would not be able to put presents under the tree for her two children after
            getting caught up in the Phoenix pay system fiasco.
            But two days after the public servant's story aired on CBC News, the government agreed to give her nearly
            $1,000 to cover most of the out-of-pocket expenses she racked up while being paid improperly.
            "Everything's going to be great," a relieved Lavallee said in a phone interview. "I'll be able to finish
            buying gifts for my kids this weekend."
            Lavallee first went weeks without pay, and was then underpaid for months, after returning to work from a
            maternity leave in April.
            Despite receiving emergency salary advances, she says it wasn't enough to cover her bills, including her
            mortgage.
            At the same time, Lavallee was in the process of separating from her husband. She had arranged to buy him
            out of his half of the family home,
            but due to the financial instability caused by Phoenix, she says she had to abandon that plan.
            Instead, she sold her family home in Gatineau, Que., and moved with her children to an apartment in Ottawa.
            On Wednesday, Lavallee told CBC News that decision was "absolutely terrible. It was one of the worst things
            I've ever had to do."
            The majority of her pay issues were resolved by September.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Four members of the Jordanian security forces and a woman visiting from Canada were killed in Sunday's
            attacks, officials said. Here, an officer of the Jordanian public security department stands guard in the
            northern city of Irbid, Jordan, in March. (Muhammad Hamed/Reuters)
            Gunmen carried out a series of attacks in central Jordan on Sunday, including at a Crusader castle popular
            with tourists, killing four members of the Jordanian security forces and a woman visiting from Canada,
            officials said.
            The shootings were the latest in a series of attacks that have challenged the pro-Western kingdom's claim to
            be an oasis of calm in a region threatened by Islamic extremists.
            There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks in and near the central town of Karak.
            The chain of events began when a police patrol received reports of a house fire in the town of Qatraneh in
            the Karak district, said a statement by Jordan's Public Security Directorate.
            The officers responding to the call came under fire from inside the house, the statement said. Two policemen
            were wounded and the assailants fled in a car, it said.
            In another attack, gunmen fired on a security patrol in Karak, causing no injuries, the statement said.
            In a third incident, armed men opened fire on a police station in Karak Castle, a Crusader fort, wounding
            members of the security forces. The statement said five or six gunmen were believed to be inside the castle.
            Their fate was not immediately known, and it was not clear if the standoff was still going on at nightfall
            Sunday.
            In all, four members of the security forces and a female tourist from Canada were killed in the shootings,
            though it was not clear if all five were killed at the castle.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Since meeting Aleppo Mayor Brita Hagi Hasan in Paris on December 5, Hidalgo has helped raise awareness of those in the affected part of the besieged city.
            She sent a letter sent to the Pope asking him to intervene in favor of a peaceful solution in Syria, hung a
            banner on the façade of the Paris
            Town Hall to show Parisians' solidarity and wrote a letter to the World Congress of Mayors (UCLG) to enlist
            their support.
            On Wednesday, the ceasefire brokered by Turkey with Russia for eastern Aleppo collapsed less than a day
            after it was implemented,
            as Turkey and activists on the ground accused the regime and other forces of heavy shelling and bombardment.
            Deaths were reported on both sides Wednesday, while some 50,000 civilians -- low on food and medical
            supplies -- were believed to remain
            inside the small pocket of eastern Aleppo still under rebel control.
            The ceasefire was aimed at evacuating both rebels and civilians, but by late afternoon the promised
            evacuations had not taken place.
            "While the reasons for the breakdown in the ceasefire are disputed, the resumption of extremely heavy
            bombardment by the Syrian government
            forces and their allies on an area packed with civilians is almost certainly a violation of international
            law and most likely constitutes war crimes," he said in a statement.]]></text>

        <title>Spain is trying to kill the siesta</title>
        <url>http://money.cnn.com/2016/12/14/news/economy/spain-time-zone-siesta/index.html</url>

        <text><![CDATA[Spain is hoping to kill off its famed "siesta" naps by moving to a new time zone.
            Labor minister Fátima Báñez has this week revived a proposal to change the country's clocks, saying the move
            would help ensure the working day ended at 6 p.m. and give workers more time with their families.
            It's expected the move would boost worker productivity.
            Spain has flirted with a change for years because the country's clocks don't jive with when the sun rises
            and sets, leading to longer work days.
            Spain's long-time dictator Francisco Franco moved the country's clocks forward an hour to Central European
            Time in the early 1940s to align with Nazi Germany. But the change has stuck for more than 70 years.
            This long-lasting quirk means Spanish workers tend to wake up in the dark, take mid-day siestas -- aka naps
            -- and eat late dinners. Bedtime for Spaniards can be well after midnight -- which means less sleep and lower productivity.]]></text>

        <title>Ballon d'Or 2016: Cristiano Ronaldo beats Lionel Messi to best player award</title>
        <url>http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/12/football/ballon-dor-2016-ronaldo-messi/index.html</url>

        <text><![CDATA[Ronaldo was unable to attend the awards ceremony in Paris as Real Madrid had traveled to Japan to take
            part in the FIFA Club World Cup, holding a six-point lead over Barca in La Liga after Saturday's win over
            Deportivo La Coruna.
            "For me it's an unbelievable moment, I'm so proud, so happy," he said in a pre-recorded interview.
            "Thank you to everyone who voted for me. Thank you to my teammates ... Portugal national team, and this
            trophy's for Real Madrid."
            Although the 31-year-old had to leave the field after just 25 minutes of the Euro 2016 final against host
            nation France due to injury, his three goals and three assists had helped drag Portugal to the latter stages
            of the tournament.
            It only qualified for the knockout rounds as one of the best third-placed group teams, drawing with Iceland,
            Austria and Hungary.
            Following the end of its merged agreement with football's governing body FIFA, the 2016 Ballon d'Or award --
            now run solely by its founder France Football magazine -- was decided by a vote of 173 journalists for the
            30 nominated players.
            In 2010-15, it also featured votes from national team captains and managers.
            FIFA will award its own prize for the world's top performing player -- with Ronaldo, Messi and Atletico
            Madrid striker Antoine
            Griezmann shortlisted -- in a ceremony due to be held on January 9 in Zurich, Switzerland.
            Griezmann, who was top scorer at Euro 2016 with six goals for losing finalist France, was third behind Messi
            in the Ballon d'Or voting.
            Messi's Barca clubmates Luis Suarez and Neymar were fourth and fifth respectively ahead of Real's Gareth
            Bale, a semifinalist at Euro 2016 with Wales.
            Ronaldo's success was foreshadowed late Sunday when an image purporting to show a leaked front cover of the
            latest edition of France Football -- declaring him the winner -- appeared on social media late Sunday.
            Ronaldo first won the coveted prize in 2008, doing so again in 2013 and 2014. He and Messi have been the
            only winners since Brazil's Kaka took the honor in 2007.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA["It is thus necessary, in the eyes of the government, to include the whole electoral period in the renewal time that we ask for," he added.
Last month, then-Prime Minister Manuel Valls said the provisions would likely be extended to give the extra powers delegated by emergency laws "to protect our democracy" during the April-May presidential vote.
Valls has said that authorities were monitoring around 15,000 people in France who they believe are in the process of radicalization and warned of hundreds of French jihadists fighting in Iraq and Syria.
The provisions giving police additional powers in terror investigations were first implemented after a series of attacks left 130 people dead throughout Paris on November 13, 2015.
The terrorists struck in coordinated attacks at the Stade de France, outside the Petit Cambodge restaurant, in the Boulevard Voltaire, the Bonne Biere and the Belle Equipe cafes.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Thousands of cabin crew workers at British Airways are preparing to strike just a few days before Christmas.
The Unite union, which represents 2,500 BA cabin crew, said a strike could happen as early as December 22, disrupting roughly 50 short and long-haul routes.
Most of the cabin crew members represented by the union work out of London's Heathrow, one of the world's busiest travel hubs.
The vast majority of BA flights, however, wouldn't be affected by a strike. Fewer than one in five BA cabin crew staffers are members part of this particular union.
Unite argues that its members are not paid a decent salary and roughly half of the cabin crew take second jobs to pay the bills. Members have rejected a proposed pay raise of 2%.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA["We are ready to work with state and federal entities to secure the appropriate and necessary support to deliver educational services to all who, in light of today's development, may arrive in our community," Carvalho said in a statement Saturday.
But a surge of immigrants from Cuba have already been making their way to the United States.
Experts say several factors are fueling a spike in the number of Cubans who brave dangerous journeys by land and by sea. Chief among them: fear that US policies that put Cubans on a fast track to legal residency could be repealed as relations between the two countries improve.
Could that happen? It's possible, but the reason might have more to do with who's in the White House then who's at the helm in Cuba.
He's also slammed the Cuban Adjustment Act, which makes Cuban immigrants eligible to apply for a green card after a year and a day in the country.]]></text>

        <title>Tunisian court approves marriage of pregnant 13-year-old</title>

        <text><![CDATA[A Tunisian court Tuesday has approved the marriage of a 13-year-old girl to a 20-year-old relative who made her pregnant, a move that caused an uproar among organizations concerned with children's rights in the country.
The marriage between the girl, from the northwestern region of Kef, and the brother of her brother-in-law took place in the presence of their parents, despite attempts to stop it.
The judge was relying on an article in the Tunisian Criminal Code which stipulates that while sex with a girl under 15 without the use of force is punishable by six years in prison, the culprit can halt proceedings by marrying the victim.
"In that particular case, the judge was simply abiding the law, which is definitely an antiquated law," a fellow court judge, who did not want to be named because they are not authorized to speak with media, told CNN.
"Tunisia was one of the first countries in the region to ratify international treaties that guarantee the rights of children. However this law was never amended. It's up to the judge to decide whether to apply it or not," the judge said.
They called on the government to protect the pregnant girl and ensure that she continues her education.
It also called on the country's parliament to speed up the process of adopting a bill to counter violence against women. The bill was proposed in 2014 but is still waiting to be discussed.
The proposed bill would introduce sweeping definitions of gender-based violence, covering psychological and economic harm in both the public and domestic spheres. Marital rape would be outlawed and there would be an end to impunity for rapists if their victims are under 20 and they subsequently marry them.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Following a pay dispute with Qatari club El Jaish, Belounis was not granted permission to leave the country. He contemplated a hunger strike and even suicide before he was allowed to leave after an intervention by the French government.
Qatar's Government Communications Office vehemently denied Amnesty's claims in a statement on Monday.
"We remain committed to the development of a labor system that is fair to both employers and employees alike," it said. "These new legislative changes, combined with ongoing enforcement and a commitment to systemic reform ... will ensure workers' rights are respected across the entire labor pathway."
The intention to implement new laws was first declared in 2015, in a statement that promised to fine employers for confiscating workers' passports, and unveiled the formation of an Exit Permit Grievances Committee.
It also promised to remove Qatar's heavily criticized "kafala" system, a practice common in the Middle East where expats rely on their employers for visa sponsorships and maintaining legal status.
In general, workers were not allowed to switch jobs without approval from their current employers.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[The UK's fertility regulator has given the green light to a treatment that will make it possible for babies to be made from two women and a man. The new advancement in in vitro fertilization, developed by doctors in Newcastle, is intended to prevent children being born with certain fatal genetic diseases.
Mitochondria have their own DNA, which controls only mitochondrial function and energy production.
This is separate from our "nuclear DNA," which makes us who we are and determines appearance and personality.
Known as "mitochondrial donation," the IVF technique involves replacing faulty mitochondria inherited from the mother with the healthy mitochondria of another woman.
Most of a cell's genetic material, or DNA, is contained within the nucleus, but a very small amount (less than 1%) is found in the mitochondria.
This mitochondrial DNA is inherited only from the mother through her eggs.
If the mother's mitochondrial DNA is faulty, it is possible that she may pass on a number of rare but very serious mitochondrial diseases, including muscle weakness, diabetes, heart problems, epilepsy and stroke-like episodes. In serious cases, they can lead to death.
About 1 in 6,500 children are thought to develop a serious mitochondrial disorder, according to Newcastle's Wellcome Trust Centre for Mitochondrial Research, which has been a leading partner in the project.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Washington (CNN)
ExxonMobil Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson is the leading candidate for Secretary of State in a Donald Trump administration, multiple sources familiar with the transition process tell CNN.
The final announcement is expected to be made in the middle of this week, according to a source close to the campaign. A source also said Mitt Romney is still in the running, at the urging of Reince Priebus, who will be Trump's chief of staff.
Tillerson, who met with Trump in New York Saturday, is considered one of the faces of Big Oil globally.
Tillerson has told the President-elect he would be honored to have the job of secretary of state and left Saturday's meeting believing he will be the pick, according to two sources familiar with his thinking.
One said Tillerson was told the President-elect will formalize his choice this week -- as in extend an official offer.
Both sources shared information on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the issue for the record. Trump's spokesman Jason Miller tweeted Saturday that there would be "no announcements on Secretary of State until next week at the earliest."
Tillerson was originally considered a long shot to be America's top diplomat, but Trump is reportedly intrigued by the oil man's view of the world.
"He is much more than a business executive. He is a world class player. He is in charge of, I guess, the largest company in the world," Trump told Fox News' Chris Wallace in an interview airing Sunday. "And to me, a great advantage is that he knows many of the players. And he knows them well."
"He does massive deals in Russia. He does massive deals -- for the company, not for himself, for the company," the real estate mogul added.
Trump echoed those comments in a tweet later Sunday morning.
"Whether I choose him or not for 'State'- Rex Tillerson, the Chairman & CEO of ExxonMobil, is a world class player and dealmaker. Stay tuned!"
As head of the world's most valuable oil company, Tillerson could be a controversial pick due to concerns about climate change and his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
On Sunday morning, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a former GOP presidential primary rival of Trump's, expressed concern about a Tillerson pick without naming the oil executive.
"Being a 'friend of Vladimir' is not an attribute I am hoping for from a #SecretaryOfState - MR," Rubio tweeted.
Sen. John McCain told CNN on Saturday that he had concerns about Tillerson's relationship to Russia and wants to hear his answers to such during his would-be hearing before making up his mind.
"What about all the other things -- right now, the targeting of hospitals by Russian aircraft with precision weapons in Syria, in Aleppo?" the Arizona Republican asked ahead of the Army-Navy football game. "Those are the kind of questions that we need to ask about the relationship with Vladimir Putin."
In 2011, Exxon signed a deal with Russian oil giant Rosneft to provide access to lucrative oil resources in the Arctic.
Rosneft's largest shareholder is the Russian government. Putin attended the Exxon signing ceremony and later awarded Tillerson the country's Order of Friendship.
Other contenders for the secretary of state position include former CIA Director David Petraeus; Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker; and former UN Ambassador John Bolton.
Bolton could become the #2 at the State Department, but no offer has yet been extended. The transition wants to announce the secretary of state nominee and deputy as a package deal next week.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA["The Martyred Saint Sebastian" depicts the early Christian saint bound to a tree. This new discovery is the third known da Vinci sketch of the subject.
The artist mentioned eight drawings of the saint in his Codex Atlanticus.
The doctor, whose identity has not been disclosed, brought 14 drawings inherited from his father to Prate's Paris office in March. He'd had the drawings for years, but only after retiring did he resolve to have them valued.
Prate assumes the doctor's father, a book collector, acquired the drawings at a bookstore in the early 20th century, as they had all been mounted on paper mats rather than framed.
Intrigued by the drawing's apparent age, Prate enlisted Patrick de Bayser, an expert in the valuation of Old Masters drawings, to confirm the artist. The paper frame had the name Michelangelo, but the expert doubted that was the artist of this particular drawing.]]></text>

        <title>Local media: Blast at Cairo cathedral kills at least 25</title>
        <url>http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/11/middleeast/egypt-coptic-church/index.html</url>
        <domain>www.cnn.com</domain>
        <dltime></dltime>
        <text><![CDATA[Security fears swept across Cairo on Monday as police probed the deadly bomb blast that ripped through a Coptic church the day before.
The explosion Sunday morning -- in the city's Abbassiya district -- hit the small church of St. Peter and St. Paul attached to the St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral, said the Coptic Church's official spokesperson, Rev. Paul Halim, according to the government-sponsored Al-Ahram news outlet.
At least 25 people are dead and dozens injured, Al-Ahram said, citing the health ministry.
Egyptian state news agency MENA reported, citing security sources, said a 12-kilogram TNT bomb caused the blast..
In response to questions from CNN about the size of the bomb, a police official who asked not to be named told CNN: "It is too early to determine the type and amount of the explosives used," and authorities are unable to confirm reports about a 12-kilogram bomb.
No claim of responsibility
The attack targeted one of the most symbolic religious sites for Copts, an ethno-religious group centered in Egypt. The Coptic Orthodox Church released a statement on its Facebook page, saying in part:
"As we are bereaved by this violence and terrorism that attacks worshipers, we pray for these martyrs and for the wounded. The Egyptian church stresses on persevering national unity that keeps all Egyptians on Egypt's blessed land."
Video from the scene shows shards of glass and other debris scattered across the chapel's floor. Patches of blood cover some of the wooden pews.
There has been no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.
A militant group responsible for a string of deadly attacks targeting Egyptian security forces condemned the bombing.
"Our prophet had taught us even while we fight not to kill a child nor woman nor old person nor worshiper in his place of worship," the Harakat Sawa'd Misr, or Hasam Movement, said in a statement on its Facebook page.
Swift condemnations
President Abdel Fattah El Sisi condemned the attack and declared a three-day period of national mourning.
The Grand Mufti, the highest official of religious law in Egypt, condemned the "deplorable terrorist attack" on the cathedral.
"Attacking churches whether by demolition, bombing, killing those inside, or terrifying ... secure people are prohibited in Islamic Sharia," Sheikh Shawky Ibrahim Abdel-Karim Allam said.
He called for unity against "black terrorism that tries to instigate sectarianism and sedition among the two wings of Egypt -- Muslims and Christians -- in a bid to weaken the nation."
The Grand Mufti also extended his condolences to Pope Tawadros ll of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria.
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside the cathedral Sunday to voice their anger at police and some pro-government television anchors, according to Al-Ahram.
They called for the resignation of the interior minister, Magdy Abdel Ghaffar.
Protesters chanted: "This time won't pass, even if we all die. ...  This is not sectarian strife, let's get the world to hear."
Sunday's explosion came just two days after two bombs killed six police officers and a civilian in Giza's Haram district, on the street leading to the city's famed pyramids.
Copts facing persecution
A nun reacts as Egyptian security forces inspect the scene of a bomb explosion at the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Coptic Orthodox Church on December 11, 2016, in Cairo's Abbasiya neighbourhood.
Copts face persecution and discrimination that has spiked since the toppling of Hosni Mubarak's regime in 2011. Dozens have been killed in sectarian clashes. There is also little Christian representation in Egypt's government.
Coptic Christians make up about 10 percent of Egypt's 91 million residents. They base their theology on the teachings of the Apostle Mark, who introduced Christianity to Egypt, according to St. Takla Church in Alexandria, the capital of Coptic Christianity.]]></text>

        <title>56 patients missing after escape from Kenyan mental facility

        <text><![CDATA[Hours after medical workers', strike began on Monday, 61 patients from the country's largest mental
            facility escaped the hospital grounds, climbing an exterior wall and wandering across the Kenyan capital.
"After giving treatment and going to the other wards the patients were left unattended and they climbed the wall and wandered away from the hospital," said Julius Ogato, Medical Superintendent of Mathari National Teaching and Referral Hospital.
More than 24 hours later, just five of the missing patients had been found.
A video shared by a local newspaper shows the time of escape as some patients casually walk, and others run away in their hospital clothing. The facility held more than 750 patients at the time and only five nurses out of 195 person nursing staff had showed up to work that day.
As the strike continued across the country, patients have been turned away from treatment.
The Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPPDU) says the strike is intended to push for the government to implement a collective bargaining commitment signed three years ago, which advocates for increased doctor hires and better pay.]]></text>

        <title>60 days clean, fentanyl addict Kati Mather has changed drastically since CBC last spoke to her</title>

        <text><![CDATA[Considering how her life was going in September, Kati Mather made an improbable appearance at a vigil to reflect on fentanyl deaths in Vancouver and push for more long-term treatment for addicts.
"If I didn't choose to get clean when I did, then I'd probably be dead today, and that's thanks to treatment," said Mather, 22, on Saturday from the steps of the Vancouver Art Gallery.
In September, the CBC's Eric Rankin found her sitting in a pile of garbage bags along an infamous strip in Surrey, B.C.
She spoke candidly about her addiction and the risk that came with it.
"I overdosed 17 times," said Mather, who added that for the past seven years she has used oxycontin, heroin and then finally only fentanyl.
"Being close to death and going down to the place I was at has made me really want to change and as an addict, really the only way that you can get better is that you really have to want it."
Mather is now in a long-term treatment program at Westminster House, along with her twin sister, Jessi.
Alongside a small group of other recovering addicts, they lit candles on Saturday at an event put on by Recovery Day B.C., an organization that advocates for abstinence-based treatment programs.]]></text>

        <title>As home prices soar, some first-time buyers reconsider home ownership dreams</title>

        <text><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Meghan Morrison and her fiance made the difficult decision to add two hours of commuting onto their day in order to pursue their dream of owning a house.
The couple could have purchased a condo in the Toronto area, where they both work, but Morrison says they wanted more space to be able to engage in their hobbies and, eventually, start a family.
"We looked at new builds in Toronto and it's just like, oh my gosh, $400,000 for 600 square feet," says Morrison, 26.
In January, the couple will be moving into their newly purchased, two-storey brick home in Barrie, Ont., complete with a two-car garage and a large, fenced-in yard for their French bulldog to play in.
"It was a really tough decision," Morrison says. "We struggled with it for a long time. But we just couldn't see ourselves living in a condo forever."
Exurban exodus
With home prices in Toronto, Vancouver and their surrounding areas soaring increasingly out of reach, many first-time buyers are being forced to either move out of the city or reconsider their home ownership dreams.
But in oil-producing provinces such as Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland — where the plummet in the price of crude has hampered economic growth — the picture is starkly different.
Phil Soper, president of Royal LePage, says sales volumes are down about 20 per cent in Alberta from their long-term average.
"The regional disparities are as great as I've ever seen them," Soper says.
"Depending on your views, it was one of the toughest years in the housing market since the Great Recession, or it's crazy overheated and the government should step in and do something about it."
CIBC deputy chief economist Benjamin Tal predicts softer markets in Toronto and Vancouver in the year ahead, as government changes — including the 15 per cent tax on foreign buyers in Vancouver and federal mortgage rules changes — are felt.
Both the B.C. and Ontario governments have also announced efforts lately to help first-time buyers get into the market.
The B.C. government launched a plan to offer loans to help first-time homebuyers get into the real estate market. The loans are interest-free and payment-free for the first five years.
"Clearly 2016 has been, from a policy perspective, a very important year that will impact the trajectory of the housing market in the coming years," Tal said.
Soper says price growth is expected to slow in the Greater Toronto Area, and possibly reverse in Vancouver, but there could be a return to moderate growth in Alberta and other oil-producing regions.
The new mortgage rules introduced by Ottawa in October, which require all insured mortgages to undergo a stress test, will likely cause some would-be buyers to keep renting instead, Tal said.
"I do think that the rental market will be even tighter," he said.
Change of plans
That could spell trouble for people like Nicole Silver, a 23-year-old marketing and public relations professional in the Toronto area.
After spending years living at home with her family to save money, Silver was ready to put down a $60,000 to $70,000 down payment on a condo this fall.
But she soon discovered that even condo prices had climbed out of her reach.
"If I had done this a little bit earlier, like a couple of months earlier, maybe it would have been better," Silver says. "I feel like every month it's getting worse and worse."
Although she's still keeping an eye on the market, Silver says she's more or less resigned herself to renting.
"I don't want to just be paying rent to live in someone else's home," she says. "I'm not very happy with that, but it's just the reality."
Heather Rollwagen, assistant professor of sociology at Ryerson University, says home ownership is important to many Canadians because it's culturally constructed as economic security.
"I think people are kind of told that renting is irresponsible somehow," Rollwagen says.
However, buying a property is not necessarily more economically secure, Rollwagen says — particularly for lower income earners who take on large debts and therefore become vulnerable to changes in interest rates.
"I'm eager to see, over the next 10 or 15 years, how millennials' attitudes are going to drive changes in the value of home ownership, because they're the ones that are really starting to opt out," she says.]]></text>

        <title>Provinces take aim at health care 'ultimatum'</title>

        <text><![CDATA[Provincial ministers are criticizing what they describe as a lacklustre take-it-or-leave-it offer delivered by the Trudeau government ahead of what have become increasingly bitter talks around federal health-care funding.
Several provinces insisted Sunday that a proposal by the federal Liberals on health funding was presented as an ultimatum — even though they maintain there hadn't been any real negotiations.
On top of that, the provincial ministers argue that Ottawa's latest offer would likely leave provincial health budgets in an even worse financial situation than if the Liberals allow health transfers to fall, as planned, and proceed with what they had promised in their 2015 campaign platform.
Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau said late Sunday that he hoped the provinces would have an open mind heading into the discussions.
Provincial and territorial finance ministers were expected to turn up the pressure when they sat down for a working dinner Sunday with Morneau. Talks were to continue Monday and health ministers from across the country were expected to join in during a special afternoon session.
Morneau has said he's "cautiously optimistic" that an agreement could be reached and, on his way into Sunday's dinner, he told reporters that Ottawa planned to put forward an important idea focused on mental health and home care.
The two sides, however, appeared to be far apart late Sunday.
'We're not satisfied'
"I can talk for everyone across the country — we're not satisfied with the way things are conducted," Quebec Health Minister Gaetan Barrette said Sunday in an interview.
"There's been no negotiations whatsoever during the last year and we are being served an ultimatum by Bill Morneau, which is totally insulting and inappropriate...
"Unless he proposes something better than what he put on the table, things are going to be very bad tomorrow."
Even as provincial finance ministers started travelling to the capital Sunday to push for more federal support, the Trudeau government showed no signs it was prepared to budge on its plan to clamp down on increases to health-transfer payments.
The federal Finance Department released figures Sunday showing that the Liberals were banking on just a three per cent increase in health care funding in 2017-18, far below what provinces and territories are requesting. In all, the numbers revealed that Ottawa intended to provide $37.15 billion next year in health transfers, up from the almost $36.1 billion in payments this year.
Ottawa has publicly said it plans to stick with a plan set by the previous Conservative government to see the six per cent annual increase in federal health funding fall to three per cent. Morneau has said that the federal government would put a "significant" amount of money into specific areas such as home care and mental health over a period longer than five years.
However, several provinces say that Morneau made them a different offer Friday morning.
Barrette and British Columbia Finance Minister Michael de Jong said Morneau has proposed a firm 3.5 per cent annual increase in transfers as well as another $8 billion over 10 years for specific areas such as home care and mental health. Ottawa is also talking about investing $1 billion into home-care infrastructure over four years, he said.
The offer, de Jong said in an interview Sunday, could mean even less money for provinces over the next decade compared to just leaving the Liberals to follow through on their plan to invest $3 billion over four years into home care and to allow the six per cent annual increase in transfers fall to a floor of either three per cent or an average of nominal economic growth — whichever is higher.
'Clever proposal'
In their platform, the Liberals promised to allow the six per cent annual increase in transfers to fall to a floor of either three per cent or an average of nominal economic growth — whichever is higher.
De Jong noted that the federal government's own projections predict that nominal growth will average above 3.5 per cent over the next decade.
"A clever proposal but not one that really addresses the pressures and a disappointment for us," de Jong said in an interview Sunday evening before entering Sunday's dinner meeting with his federal and provincial counterparts.
Even including the Liberal platform's pledge of $3 billion over four years for home care, de Jong said he didn't think his province would be better off.
He also voiced concerns about the way he says the offer was delivered.
"The take it or leave it attitude that seems to be emanating from the Prime Minister's Office on this is not productive, it's certainly not collaborative, and really not acceptable," de Jong said.
"That's disappointing. It's certainly a departure from what the prime minister indicated in terms of the approach he wanted to take."
Barrette said if the provinces accept Morneau's offer of a locked-in 3.5 per cent annual increases then the federal share of health funding will actually decrease from about 23 per cent right now to possibly under 20 per cent.
On Friday, Morneau called provincial demands for bigger federal health funding transfers "out of the realm" of anything Ottawa would consider.
One proposal supported by at least several provinces has asked Ottawa to maintain the annual transfer increases at least as high as 5.2 per cent, while another provincial pitch has called on the federal government to ensure its share of provincial health-care budgets is pegged at 25 per cent.
But Morneau insisted the federal government wouldn't agree to keep the annual increases in transfers above three per cent, nor would Ottawa raise its share of spending to 25 per cent of provincial health budgets.
Ottawa's plan to allow annual health transfers to fall from six per cent to three per cent would trim nearly $1.1 billion this year from its combined payments to the provinces.]]></text>

        <title>Death, extortion and hope: 1 man's fight for a new liver</title>
        <url>http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/liver-transplant-hope-1.3899765</url>
        <domain>www.cbc.ca</domain>
        <dltime>2016-12-19 16:55 ET</dltime>
        <text><![CDATA[In Ontario, someone dies every three days while waiting for an organ transplant. About 220 people are waiting for a new liver and Arch Walsh of Mississauga is one of them.
Walsh had hoped a living donor might come forward, but that prospect dimmed when someone who was a match backed out, after demanding financial compensation.
"I can barely rest," said Walsh, who looks like a shell of the tall, husky man he was — until last December when he got sick.
"My bones rub together when I sleep," he told CBC Toronto.
Walsh has Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), a condition where fatty deposits inside the liver become inflamed, causing the organ to scar and enlarge. NASH is a more severe form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and can develop, as with Walsh's case, into cirrhosis. By Stage 4, the damage is irreversible. Walsh's liver is operating at 20 per cent.
A brush with death
Every two weeks Walsh goes to Trillium Health Centre in Mississauga to have a catheter stuck into his distended, water-filled abdomen to drain the fluids. It has to be done carefully, so his bowel and other organs won't be punctured.
"My abdomen just started swelling to the point where it looked like I was nine months pregnant," Walsh said as he described the first time he landed in the emergency room last December.
"The doctors drained 15 litres from my abdomen." It's a routine he'll undergo biweekly until he dies or he gets a new liver.
The husband and father of four has been preparing for death since that day in December.
A brush with extortion
Walsh went through seven months of these painful drainage treatments before being put on the organ donor list. It was a glimmer of hope that quickly dimmed.
"It became readily apparent there were just not enough donors in the deceased donor bank," he said
Walsh's family and friends volunteered to go through the screening process for becoming living donors.
Unfortunately for Walsh, no one was a match for his O Positive blood type. Except one friend, a man Walsh says he knew for years.
"He was the rare and perfect fit," Walsh said.
The donor (Walsh did not want to disclose his name), went through every stage of the program's screening process.
Walsh's surgery was scheduled for Sept. 26, but just days before he was to go under the knife, the donor called him.
The man told Walsh he would need to pay him $200,000 to go through with the operation, Walsh said.
"I indicated to the individual that I'd rather die than be subjected to extortion," he said.
"We went from absolute heaven, seeing a life for myself and a future, to hell with being dead in a matter of days."
Now Walsh is back to square one, waiting in the queue for a liver donation from someone who has died, unless another living donor volunteers and actually follows through with the surgery.
About one-quarter of living liver donors get cold feet
"We make it very clear from the first day that donors always have the option of opting out," said Dr. Leslie Lilly, medical director of the Toronto General Hospital Transplant Clinic, "And it doesn't happen all that infrequently because of the magnitude of the surgery."
The living donor will have 50 to 70 per cent of the liver removed and transplanted into the recipient.
The donor's liver will regenerate in 12 weeks, but Dr. Lilly says the surgery and required time off to heal can be daunting. He says about one quarter of approved donors back out at some point. But nothing came as close as Walsh's case.
"His case was the closest I have seen it get."
Walsh hopes his story will inspire a new, comparable donor to come forward for him, but he also hopes to serve as an example of how crucial live donors are to people on the wait list.
Ontario's largest cities have the fewest donors
While the number of patients waiting for a transplant continues to increase, the rate of donors registering in Ontario is rising slightly but remains at about 30 per cent. The rate is driven lower by lack of interest in organ donation in the province's largest cities like Toronto and the GTA.
Just 21 per cent of Toronto's Ontario health-card holders are organ donors. The figure for Mississauga, where Walsh lives, is 20 per cent.
Some think diverse cultural beliefs explain why major GTA cities have the fewest registered donors by percentage  Dr. Lilly says it could be a factor.
Organ donation is permitted under Jewish law and most Christian denominations and Islamic scholars have endorsed both donation and transplantation.
"I think that people themselves may perceive for their own belief systems that organ donation is not consistent with their religious beliefs, but actually if you talk to leaders of those religions, donation is actually strongly endorsed," said Dr. Lilly.]]></text>

        <title>Manitoba premier says he'll be in Costa Rica six to eight weeks a year</title>

        <text><![CDATA[Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister plans to spend six to eight weeks a year at his vacation home in Costa Rica during his time in office, including this holiday season, but says he will be getting work done while there.
"When I go down there, I work," Pallister said in a year-end interview with The Canadian Press at his legislature office.
"I work at things that I don't get interrupted at, and I do get some time with my family, which is great because I don't get much time with my family when I'm here."
Pallister's Costa Rica travels came under fire in the election campaign in the spring, when a CBC investigation revealed Pallister had spent roughly one in five days travelling to or in Costa Rica since being elected Progressive Conservative leader in 2012.
A few weeks earlier, Pallister had told the Winnipeg Free Press that he had not been in Costa Rica in early 2016 when in fact he had been.
The premier and his staff appear to have now adopted a more upfront communications plan on his southern trips, said Royce Koop, a political studies professor at the University of Manitoba.
"It does seem to be the case that they've adopted the strategy of getting ahead of this," Koop said. "They're being open with the amount of time he's going to be away instead of allowing the opposition to figure it out and break it as a story."
Pallister said one reason he spent so much time in Costa Rica initially was because he was developing his property. The Costa Rica Star newspaper reported earlier this year that Pallister owns three properties that cover a combined five hectares.
He also said the 10 months a year he spends in Manitoba is more than a year's worth of work.
"I typically work a 60-hour week, so in the 10 months that I am here, I'm typically doing 15 months of work, and I'm proud of that.
"Pallister men, on their headstones, they just want 'he was a good worker."']]></text>

        <title>CBC INVESTIGATES | Stronger opioids straining supply of life-saving overdose antidote in Vancouver ER

        <text><![CDATA[Emergency room doctors and nurses in Vancouver suspect a drug originally used to tranquillize elephants might be the reason they've had to drastically increase their supply of a life-saving opioid antidote.
Carfentanil is the most toxic form of synthetic opioid. Authorities believe it's being manufactured in clandestine labs in Asia and smuggled to Canada in small packages.
At St. Paul's Hospital in downtown Vancouver, the doctors and nurses who treat a constant stream of overdose patients believe they're seeing the drug's dangerous effects up close.
Dr. Kevin Nemethy says a single dose of opioid antidote naloxone (brand name Narcan) used to be enough to wake up an overdose patient.
"Now we are not finding the desired effect until we give 10 times the dose or even 20 times the dose of naloxone," he told CBC News during a particularly busy shift on Nov. 24 — the day after the last provincial social assistance cheques were issued.
Tanya Campbell, the emergency department's nurse leader, says the number of overdoses is overwhelming and the patients appear to be taking stronger drugs.
"We actually start them on a continuous drip of Narcan, if they are not waking up," she said. "Sometimes we have to take over their airway till they get the drugs out of their system and they wake up."
B.C. lab can't test for carfentanil
She says she believes some patients get tricked into buying opioids like carfentanil when they think they're buying heroin.
Vancouver police have confirmed they've seized drugs containing carfentanil. But the province's coroner has yet to confirm how many of the  755 overdose deaths in B.C. so far this year are linked to the drug because its toxicology centre can't test for it.
The Provincial Health Services Authority says the lab received the necessary licence last week, but equipment needs to be calibrated and testing for carfentanil won't start for two to three months.
Alberta's lab is already equipped and has linked the drug to  15 deaths.
Nurse Campbell fears naloxone will soon be no match for carfentanil.
"I think that's a fear that all of us have as health-care workers," she said. "That one day, we are not going to be able to even try to save these people.
"We're going to have a horrific amount of people dying on the street because we don't know what they are taking."
Officials at St. Paul's say there was a night in late October when the emergency room was so overwhelmed with overdose patients, they nearly ran out of naloxone and had to get a delivery from a nearby hospital.
"That's unheard of and we're the overdose centre of Vancouver, maybe Canada," said Dr. Dan Kalla, head of the emergency department.
"We are going through so much because we require so much naloxone … the demand is outstripping the supply."]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[A woman was killed and five others were injured when a large eucalyptus tree fell on a wedding party taking photographs at a Southern California park Saturday, authorities said.
Several people were trapped under the tree at Whittier's Penn Park, the Los Angeles County Fire Department said.
Video from the scene showed fire crews using chainsaws to cut through the downed branches.
Four of the injured suffered scrapes and bruises, officials said. A four-year-old girl was listed in critical condition due to head trauma, the Los Angeles Times reported.
Witnesses described hearing a loud crack and seeing people run from the area.
The tree could have been weakened by California's ongoing drought and recent heavy rain could have contributed to its fall, officials said.
An arborist will assess the area on Sunday, officials said.
No other details were immediately available.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[INNISFAIL - Nine-year-old Georgia Stevens is lacing her skates for success.
The Innisfail skater recently returned from Australia, where she lived for several years with her parents.
Georgia began skating at the age of four and skated down under for four years before making the move back to Innisfail in 2015.
Today Georgia skates in Red Deer, Innisfail and Edmonton for additional training and practises with coaches. Her success on the ice was seen from an early age, as Georgia was named the state champion for Queensland, Australia when she was just seven years old.
One of her most recent successes was being named to the 2016-17 Team Alberta junior development team at the Skate Canada Sectionals in Edmonton from Nov. 3 to 6.
Georgia's top six finish qualified her for Alberta's junior development team.
"They take the top six skaters aged 11 and under to represent the top skaters in Alberta. Georgia was in the top six," said Cory Stevens, Georgia's father, noting her recent local recognition.
"She was selected by the Red Deer Skating Association and was presented an emerging star award by the mayor of Red Deer (Tara Veer)," he said.
Much of that success has come from Georgia's hard work and dedication, he noted, but can also be attributed to her athleticism, a trait that runs in the family.
"She's very athletic," said Cory, noting both he and his wife Amy played competitive sports. "Her mom was competitive in figure skating and I was in hockey, but to Georgia's credit, she was very dedicated. She would skate six days a week and still does," he said. "She goes skating sometimes in the morning before school and then after school."
Georgia herself is thrilled to be selected for Team Alberta's junior development team and committed herself to achieve success in her young skating career.
"I'm very happy because I worked really hard for a long, long time and I've missed a lot of things to skate," said Georgia, noting what she likes about the sport. "It's just really fun when I'm on the ice. I get to skate and when I land a jump it makes me really happy."
Her favourite jump is an Axel or a double toe, she added, noting her role models growing up included her mother, four-time world champion figure skater Kurt Browning, who she has met in person, and 2014 Olympic silver medallist Patrick Chan.
"An Axel is pretty hard to learn," she said.
Her hard work and dedication to skating have helped inspire the young Innisfail skater to reach for the top.
"I want to go to the Olympics or skate in Disney On Ice one day," said Georgia. "I am dedicated to it. Even when I'm having a bad day I still like to go skating."]]></text>

        <title>David Hickson jailed for life for stabbing murder, stuffing body in esky</title>

        <text><![CDATA[A man who fatally stabbed a man in the neck and cut off his legs to fit the body into an esky has been found guilty of murder.
David Leslie Hickson, 34, admitted fatally stabbing New Zealand national Campbell Paterson at a house in Edmonton, south of Cairns, in November 2014.
However, Hickson had pleaded not guilty to murder, saying he acted in self-defence.
Hickson, who pleaded guilty to interfering with a corpse, chopped up Paterson's body and put his torso into a 40-litre esky before dumping it near Yarrabah, near Cairns.
It took the jury just under two hours to reach a verdict.
There were cheers from Mr Paterson's family as the verdict was read out in court this morning.
Members of Mr Paterson's family also wept as victim impact statements were read out.
This afternoon, Justice Jim Henry sentenced Hickson to life in jail, describing the crime as "despicable".
"You moved in the murky world of drug consumption and drug dealing and enforcing drug debts — there is no honour in those who move in that world," Justice Henry said.
"You had all been taking [the drug] ice in the lead up to these events.
"This case is another example of how this drug causes increased paranoia and aggression.
"It is rightly described as a dangerous drug — it is not only dangerous for those who use it, but those who come in contact with users, who sometimes suffer inexplicable violence at the user's hands."
Hickson was also sentenced to 20 months in jail for interfering with a corpse, and more than a year for almost a dozen other summary offences, including assault and drug charges.
Justine Henry described Hickson cutting off Mr Paterson's legs as "vile misconduct".
"That act of depravity constitutes a despicable indignity done to the dead body of another," he said.
The victim's sister, Kataraina Paterson, who travelled from New Zealand to attend the trial, spoke outside the court.
"Hearing the details were just awful — we are just grateful we have a guilty verdict.
"Hickson deserves to go to jail for life.
"We will heal a lot hearing this guilty verdict, although it won't bring him [her brother] back."
Hickson said he feared for his safety
During his trial, Hickson told the court he had acquired a sawn-off shotgun, a samurai sword and "zombie slayer" knife because he had feared for his safety.
But Hickson said he did not mean to kill Mr Paterson and stabbed him in self-defence.
"I put weapons at every door, just had weapons scattered everywhere, really — knives, guns, bats," he said.
He said he did not alert authorities because he "panicked".
Hickson 'worked as enforcer for crime boss'
The court heard Hickson and Mr Paterson, nicknamed "Mooks", had worked for a crime boss known as Kadro and were users of the drug ice.
Hickson told the court he was an "enforcer", collecting money for Kadro and sourcing drugs before the pair had a falling out.
In the weeks leading up to the stabbing, Hickson said one of Kadro's associates attacked him with an iron bar over the theft of money intended for the purchase of guns.
He said on another occasion, his ex-girlfriend went to his house and found the back door broken and Mr Paterson and other men going through his belongings.
Hickson said the night before the stabbing, Mr Paterson was at Hickson's house at Edmonton putting up tarps and laying plastic on the floor.
Hickson said he believed Mr Paterson was planning to do him harm in order to win favour with Kadro.
He said he discovered text messages from Kadro on Mr Paterson's mobile phone and decided to confront him.
When Mr Paterson allegedly lunged for a broken-up pair of shears on a table, Hickson said he grabbed a "zombie slayer" knife on the couch and stabbed Mr Paterson above the collar bone.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Donald Trump’s announcement that he will withdraw the United States from the trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) effectively killed the massive trade deal while simultaneously tearing a hole in Western Canada’s trade agenda in Asia.
Canada now must find other ways to stitch together opportunities for the western provinces in the Pacific. In this context, the just completed major trade mission to China by the Government of Alberta takes on even greater importance in securing the province’s future export growth. China is Canada’s second largest trading partner, after the U.S. Although the province has seen a slower growth in Asian economies in 2016, growth is projected to gradually rebound to an average of 6.2 per cent a year (2016 – 2020).
Canada currently has only one trade agreement in Asia. The TPP would have given Canadian companies seven new agreements. Further, it would have closed the gap with our major competitors in Asia – including Australia and New Zealand, which have more than a dozen trade agreements each, and Chile, which produces many of the same commodities as we do in the West and has nine agreements.
Trade agreements level the playing field and give companies an opportunity to compete for markets on an equal footing with their competitors. But they also give advantages that companies from countries with agreements can use to keep competitors out or make entry costlier and more difficult. That is the uphill climb facing Canadian companies in Asia today – struggling to climb the hill while their competitors ride the “trade agreement gondola” to the top.
In the fallout from the TPP, Ottawa will have to pursue a slower, more difficult bilateral approach, negotiating deals one by one, country by country. Meanwhile, Canada will need to find other ways to open markets, raise awareness and fill in the gaps left behind by unsigned trade agreements.
In Alberta, that means the province must increase its outreach to Asia, including more advocacy and education at home and abroad.
These kinds of investments are key, even if their returns aren’t immediately obvious. You can’t move goods to markets without roads, and you can’t access those markets without the soft infrastructure of connections, good will and strong brand.
The Government of Alberta just completed missions to China and Japan, connecting with buyers and investors and promoting Alberta industries including softwood lumber, agri-food, tourism and technology in an effort to tap into the regions’ powerful – and growing – middle class. According to the OECD, the global middle class will reach nearly 5 billion by 2030 and a majority of those consumers will be in Asia.
In Asia, Canada remains Cana-who? Never mind Alberta, which is still essentially unknown, despite these recent inroads. Australia and the U.S. are the dominant brands. We do not compete on price, but on quality, reliability, safety and other factors that require a strong sales job. The key to success, then, is showing up and being there. That takes repeated trips not just from business but, equally important, from government as a signal of deeper commitment.
This may not be the way we do business at home, or in the U.S., and as such the need may not be readily apparent to those who sell only in those markets. But if Alberta wants to realize the opportunities that lie beyond its borders – and beyond those of the U.S. and its increasing opposition to free trade – this is the reality.
State-level visits to Asian markets is something that New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland all do with frequency and resources. It is crucial that Alberta make the same investment.
There may not be stunning, headline grabbing announcements out of the China trip; those will come later. But like any good business person will tell you, in the sales game as in chess, it is never the final move for checkmate that wins the game. It is the series of moves before. This trade mission is how Alberta will set itself up for success in Asia.

        <title>Albertans show concern about carbon levy during town hall on climate plan</title>

        <text><![CDATA[Environment Minister Shannon Phillips is reassuring Albertans that the province’s climate leadership plan will benefit both the environment and their pocketbooks in the long term.
“When we roll out those efficiency programs, many people will be in a situation where their bills are reduced more than what the carbon levy would have cost,” she said Tuesday during a town hall call-in.
The plan includes introducing a tax of $20 per tonne of carbon Jan. 1, ending coal-fired electrical generation by 2030 and phasing in renewable energy sources.
Phillips had said the town halls will give Albertans an opportunity to learn more about the details of the strategy.
One Edmonton resident who called in questioned how the carbon levy would help businesses struggling due to low oil and gas prices.
“We are barely hanging on and now we have these taxes,” he said. “Can this energy plan be pushed off until Alberta is officially out of a recession?”
More than 1,000 people gathered Sunday at a Calgary rally to demand the NDP scrap its carbon tax. The event had been organized by Ezra Levant’s Rebel Media and drew people who had lost jobs in the oil and gas industry. The NDP has said carbon rebates will offset the levy for low- and middle-income families.
Households earning up to $95,000 will be eligible for a full rebate, Phillips said.
“Alberta is the only place in North America that doesn’t have any energy efficiency programming,” she said. “We have really tried to focus on more practical energy efficiencies … things like insulation … light bulbs, low-flow shower heads … not everyone can buy a brand-new car.”
Phillips also touted the recent approval of two major pipeline projects.
“Those pipeline approvals will lead to 22,000 new jobs,” she said, adding that the government plans to invest in renewable energy and clean technology.
A second town hall for southern Alberta residents will take place Dec. 14 from 7 p.m. to 8:15 p.m.
Those wanting to participate can call 1-855-808-5160 (toll-free), participate online or wait for the government’s invitation call on your land line.

        <text><![CDATA[A group representing Alberta’s liquor stores is advocating for the alcohol industry’s involvement in the sale of legalized recreational marijuana.
“It’s unfortunate from our perspective that the task force took out an entire industry for selling cannabis, especially when that industry has such a good track record,” said Ivonne Martinez, president of the Alberta Liquor Store Association. “We have high compliance, we sell in a responsible way.”
Her comments followed the release of a report Tuesday that was commissioned by the federal Liberal government. The framework document recommended that recreational marijuana shouldn’t be sold in the same locations as alcohol or tobacco. It also recommended storefront and mail-order sales to Canadians over the age of 18 and personal growing limits of four plants per person.
“We have discovered that regulation of cannabis will touch every aspect of our society,” said the 106-page report.
The task force, headed by former federal Liberal cabinet minister Anne McLellan of Edmonton, said production should be monitored with a “seed-to-sale tracking system” to prevent diversions to the black market.
“Our advice includes safeguards that we believe are important to attain the objectives set out by the government to better protect the health and safety of Canadians by regulating access to cannabis,” McLellan told a news conference in Ottawa.
Martinez said provinces should be afforded the autonomy to regulate marijuana sales.
“We at least want to be considered … when we are already selling a controlled substance in Alberta,” she said, adding the task force made the connection that selling alcohol and cannabis together would encourage the use of both. “We can’t control what consumers are going to do, but we can control that recreational marijuana is sold in a responsible and safe manner.”
She said separate entrances to stores or separate facilities may be necessary, but liquor stores should be involved in the sales.
“We’re uniquely qualified to do this,” she said. “Hopefully, we can work with government to help operators understand how to sell it and how to advise consumers.”]]></text>

        <title>Edmonton sits 8th in national health rankings</title>

        <text><![CDATA[Edmonton needs to start eating its vegetables.
Alberta's capital city sits in eighth place out of 10 Canadian cities for its socio-economic and physical health, according to a report released Tuesday morning.
The Conference Board of Canada's first-ever City Health Monitor report measures each city's performance based on 24 indicators, grouped into four categories:
The new ranking compares Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Saskatoon, Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Quebec City and Halifax.
Letter grades were assigned to assess each city's performance.
Saskatoon, Calgary and Winnipeg each earn an "A" grade. Montreal finished in 10th place and is the only city to receive an overall grade of "D." The remaining cities, including Edmonton, earned a "B" grade.
Although the standard of living within Canada's largest cities is similar, slight variations can have a major impact on the population, said Louis Theriault, vice president of Public Policy at the Conference Board of Canada.
"Overall Edmonton received a B ranking," Theriault said.
"It's not as low as the ranking seems to suggest. That said, there are definitely some areas that deserve specific attention."
Edmonton given 'B' grade
Although Edmonton's economy remains healthy, the city faltered in other categories, Theriault said.
The overall physical health of the population put Edmonton near the bottom of the list of Canadian cities. Edmonton was the only city to earn a 'D' ranking in this category.
"What stands out is when you look at population health, stroke and cancer, for whatever reason, is quite high in Edmonton compared to other cities," Theriault said in an interview with CBC Radio's Edmonton AM.
"When you look at more details around lifestyle, it's probably not the whole story, but there are some issues around smoking, for example, that could be improved."
Edmonton also finished near the bottom of the rankings for "healthy lifestyle" with elevated rates of smoking, obesity, a general lack of physical exercise and a failure to regularly eat fruit and vegetables.
"It's good in terms of healthcare access and how people feel about life but there is definitely room for improvement in terms of health outcomes and prevention strategies," Theriault said.
"It's hard to draw causalities, but it's really a full picture on where Edmonton can improve."
In looking at economies and how they influence a city's overall health, the report shows Edmonton remains among Canada's wealthiest metro areas, despite the price of oil and the economy.
With a GDP per capita of $63,780 and strong labour force participation, Edmonton came in second place for economic performance, behind first-place Calgary.
The Conference Board of Canada cautioned that benchmarking is not an end onto itself, but is intended to highlight each city's strengths and weaknesses.
"That's the objective of this kind of report, is to point to specific areas for improvement," Theriault said. "When you can act and do something preemptively, then you should."]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[A Queensland Amber Alert has been issued for four young boys after they were allegedly taken in Edmonton by 27-year-old Justine Margaret Murphy. Anyone with information is urged to call police immediately. (more)
The boys, who have not been named but are aged 9, 8, 4 and 8 months, were last seen at an Archibald Street on Tuesday morning. The amber alert was issued hours later, at 2:15 p.m., amid increasing concerns for the children's welfare.
 Specific details about the circumstances of the children's abduction were not immediately disclosed, but the Queensland Police Service said investigators believe the boys may be at "significant risk"
 The suspect, 27-year-old Justine Margaret Murphy, is known to the boys and is believed to be traveling with them south to Ingham or Townsville in a white 1997 Holden Commodore sedan with Queensland registration 878UAC. Murphy is described as Aboriginal, 178cm tall with black hair and brown eyes.
 Anyone who sees either Murphy, the children, or the vehicle is urged to call police immediately, or contact the Amber Alert hotline on 131 564.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Police are concerned about what they are calling a "significant rise" in youth crime in Far North Queensland.
Officers say in the last three months, 95 children have been charged with more than 450 crimes ranging from assault, to breaking into homes and stealing cars.
For the residents of Edmonton, just outside Cairns, the past three months have been difficult.
The head of the Traders Association and petrol station owner, Phillip Ungerer, says there is a constant problem with children out at night, breaking the law.
"It was absolutely hell out here. There was a gang of probably about 15 to 16-year-olds. They vandalised a number of businesses out here in Edmonton, graffitied everything that wasn't walking," he said.
He says the children are local to the area.
"I actually feel sorry for these kids. I mean at such a tender age in their lives, they're going nowhere," he said.
The head of the Cairns child protection and investigation unit, Detective Senior Sergeant Glen Horan, agrees offences committed by children in Far North Queensland are a major problem.
In the past two years he has seen a leap in the level of youth crime in the area and he knows who is offending.
"Statistically between 10 and 19 [years old] is the larger group of young offenders, and about 85 per cent of those young offenders are male and identify as Indigenous," he said.
"So offenders are predominantly male, though we do have some, a small group of female offenders as well who commit similar type offences."
Targeting young offenders
Since 2010 the Cairns police force has been running a specialised operation to target this rise in youth crime.
Detective Senior Sergeant Horan says these children are, for the most part, breaking into homes, assaulting people and stealing cars.
"Most of the crimes committed by young people aren't particularly sophisticated," he said.
Since July this year the Cairns juvenile justice unit has charged 95 children with more than 450 offences.
Detective Senior Sergeant Horan says in one case five boys amassed 150 charges in just three months. But he says while those figures seem high, it is not that alarming to police.
"Across a year, there's normally only a core group of offenders, so although we talk about upwards of 500 offences for the year, we would find that there's probably only a relatively low number who commit a vast majority of the offences," he said.
The figures from the Children's Court of Queensland for 2010 to 2011 point to a decrease in the number of young people coming before the courts.
But Detective Senior Sergeant Horan says that is because police are trying to use alternatives to the justice system.
"We can caution young offenders if they happen to have been previously involved in offending behaviours, we can also refer young people to youth justice conferences," he said.
"The final thing we would do is refer them to the court."
Crimes of boredom
Bob Katter is the Federal Member for Kennedy, which includes the Cairns district.
He has met with community members in Far North Queensland twice in the past six weeks, where he says the issue of youth crime comes up again and again.
He says these boys have no role models and poverty and homelessness are driving them to crime.
"If you've got to go home to a home where there are 15 people, or in some cases no home at all, you'll tend to get in mischief. A lazy mind, a not used mind, is a devil's workshop and that's part of it too - just simply boredom," he said.
Fran Lindsay is the vice-president of the Edmonton Traders' Association and a long-time resident of the region.
She says it is ultimately the responsibility of parents to supervise their children, but the problem needs an entire community approach.
"I think we all have to become involved, we can't just rubbish these young people, because there's a lot of good kids there," she said.
The Queensland Government is now expanding a program that puts police officers in schools and there will now be 50 officers in schools across the state.
Education Minister John-Paul Langbroek says the Government is aware of a problem of youth crime in Queensland's far north, but he says it is not targeting any particular area in the state.
"We have significant behavioural problems throughout the school system and not just in the state system, but we want them to work with our guidance officers and nurses, our behavioural support people," he said.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[The Red Cross Blood Service says it is concerned about the impact of dengue fever on blood donations in far north Queensland.
Nine cases of the mosquito-borne illness have been confirmed in the Cairns suburbs of Edmonton, Mount Sheridan, Bentley Park, Trinity Beach and Mooroobool.
The Cairns service was forced to close for six months after last year's dengue outbreak, in which 136 people were diagnosed.
Spokeswoman Sandy Holmes is asking potential donors to stay away from the affected areas, if possible.
"If you walk into that area, if you drive your car with your windows down, that is declared that you are in that area, at that time," she said.
"If they've been to perhaps one of the shopping centres in the area or perhaps one of the waterslide parks or something like that, they won't be able to donate whole blood at the moment but they will be able to make a plasma donation."]]></text>

        <title>Queensland Easter road toll highest in the nation with eight killed</title>

        <text><![CDATA[Queensland's holiday road toll has risen to eight, the highest in the nation, following the death of a man in Cairns in the state's far north.
Police said the motorcyclist crashed into a concrete barrier at a roundabout at Edmonton about midnight.
The man, believed to be in his 40s, died at the scene.
Queensland's Easter long weekend road toll is the highest since records began in 1992, and double that of NSW, which has the next highest count.
On Sunday afternoon, a four-year-old boy riding a scooter on the road in Kingston, south of Brisbane, was hit by a car and killed.
He had been playing with his brother.
Inspector Ivan Sikorsky said alcohol, driver behaviour, not wearing seatbelts and inattention were contributing factors in each death on Queensland's roads this Easter.
"I can state categorically that all of our deaths could have been avoidable," he said.
Road Policing Command Acting Assistant Commissioner Michael Keating said on average there were 3.5 deaths on Queensland's roads over Easter since records began in 1992.
"It is the worst count since records began," he said.
"People have made poor decisions."
Driver clocked doing 194kph in a 100 zone
Since Friday, nearly 55,000 roadside breath tests had been conducted and 458 drug tests.
Queensland Police said the highest breath test reading registered was from a driver at Coolum Beach, on the Sunshine Coast, who blew 0.241.
Officers also issued 17,000 speeding and 210 mobile phone use tickets.
Just outside of Mareeba in far north Queensland last night, a motorist clocked 194kph in a 100kph zone.
"All for the reason of rushing home so he could get ready for work," Inspector Sikorsky said.
"At 194 kilometres an hour there is very little control that driver would've had of his vehicle and it could've been another tragedy."
The national Easter road toll sits at 19, with a further three deaths recorded in Western Australia, two in Victoria, one in South Australia and the Northern Territory, and no fatalities in Tasmania or the ACT.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[GLASGOW, Ky. (WBKO) --  One woman has died after being struck by a vehicle in Glasgow.
The Glasgow Police Department says they were called to the intersection of North Jackson Highway and Hutcheson Road just after 5:00 p.m. on Saturday.
Officers found 82-year-old Geneva Morgan, of Glasgow, had been driving on Hutcheson Road when she stopped at the intersection. Morgan got out of her car and tried to remove debris that was lying in the roadway.
As she was trying to move the debris, she was struck by a Ford Crown Victoria, driven by 59-year-old James Kitchens, of Edmonton.
Morgan was pronounced dead at the scene by Barren County Coroner Tim Gibson. Kitchens was not injured in the accident.
Glasgow Police do not suspect that alcohol or drugs played a role in this accident.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[EDMONTON, Ky (WBKO) -- One of the biggest fires in Metcalfe County history, now becoming clearer to the community and investigators.
Arson investigators with Kentucky State Police and the ATF were back at the scene Thursday, set up using a mobile command unit.
"It just engulfed everything. Everything," said Valerie Taylor.
More than fifty firefighters battled the blaze at Scott's City Limits for hours Tuesday night all the way after the sun rose Wednesday.
The light showed what some feared. The building was burned to the ground.
Eyewitnesses said they could see the smoke and the flames from more than ten miles away, but one woman had a unique perspective. She woke up with the fire surrounding her.
"I'm lucky enough to here as it is. If it hadn't have been for that phone call I wouldn't be here."
Valarie Taylor has been watching the building for the owner the last six months. Asleep inside, the ring of the phone around 8:30 PM Tuesday night is what saved her life.
"When I opened the door to the room I was staying in, the smoke engulfed me."
Able to navigate her way outside with only the clothes on her back, she finally saw the chaos taking over the 10,000 square foot building.
"I walked around the side of the building and the whole back corner of it was on fire," said Taylor.
Surrounded by her daughter, Delicie, Wednesday for support, Valarie couldn't help but think of the building's history.
"He's had some pretty big name people up here."
And it's owner Kevin Scott Gentry.
"All of his family pictures, all of his mementos, anything that anybody ever gave him was in that building. His life was in that building."
Gentry wasn't in his building Tuesday night, because he's in the Barren County Detention Center, arrested in March for a murder for hire plot.
Gentry's bond was set at $250,000.
With no insurance on the property according to Valerie, and it's owner one county away, she's feeling an immense weight.
"You pick yourself up and you start all over," added Taylor.
A weight moved one day at a time.
Nearly half a dozen arson investigators with Kentucky State Police and the ATF, were on scene Wednesday.
No word yet on if foul play was involved in the fire. Witnesses said it appeared the fire may have started as small separate fires throughout the property.
KSP said the loss of the building totaled more than $1 million dollars in damage.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Police have released footage of a violent, late-night street fight between armed attackers in North London.
Seven men were convicted over the brawl that took place on a deserted street in Upper Edmonton on 25 February last year.
Two groups of young men can be seen confronting each other with weapons to settle a disagreement over money.
Hayder Bozkina, 20, accompanied by Bartek Glowacki, 21, confronted Rekan Saver, 20, before blows were exchanged with a group of men supporting Saver.
As Bozkina and Glowacki threaten the group, they eventually try to flee in their car, which causes the large group to attack the vehicle.
The group smash the car windows and attack the pair within the vehicle as it tries to get away, smashing into other vehicles parked on the street.
Bozkina and Glowacki were jailed for affray and possession of an offensive weapon, while Saver was imprisoned for affray and possession of an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.
Other participants included Mohamed Abdi, 21, who was detained under the Mental Health Act after appearing at Wood Green Crown Court charged with affray.
Meanwhile, Mahir Kilic, 27, and Mahmood Abubakr, 18, were sentenced for affray.
Detective Constable Rob Jones said: "CCTV footage shows that all those convicted armed themselves with weapons during this confrontation.
"The level of violence used was excessive and it is only by sheer luck that no person died as a result.
"All six males showed a complete disregard for the safety of themselves and anyone else who may have been passing by as they fought.
"Violence of this nature will not be tolerated by police - we will identify, arrest and put before the courts those who choose to take this path."]]></text>

        <title>Blooming marvellous: pupils transform Edmonton open space</title>

        <text><![CDATA[GREEN fingered youngsters from an Edmonton school have been hard at work transforming a plot of drab open space into a flowery wonderland.
The pupils aged nine and ten from St Edmund’s Catholic Primary School in Hertford Road, Edmonton are members of the school’s gardening club.
The children dug flower beds, planted flowers, and landscaped the Crescent Conservation Area, in Hertford Road, close to their school, to make it a nice place for the wider community.
The final design was shaped by the people of Edmonton during a public consultation which took place in summer.
The project to improve the Crescent includes a new footpath, a central paved area, an arc of shaped trees and flowerbeds containing perennial flowers that provide a dash of colour all year round.
The project is designed to sustainably manage rainwater by allowing it to run off into the flowerbeds. The flowers have been specially chosen to encourage bees and butterflies to visit the area.
Head teacher, Margaret Hanley, said:
“Our pupils have enjoyed taking responsibility for planting an area they use on their way to  and from school. It has helped them to demonstrate good skills of citizenship, serving their community through their hard work.
“And it was great fun!”
Enfield Council’s cabinet member for education, children’s services and protection, Ayfer Orhan, said:
“This is a brilliant project, which has allowed the children to participate in a scheme that benefits the wider community.
"Every time they visit The Crescent they will be reminded how their efforts have made a genuine difference to the community and they should have an immense sense of pride and achievement in what they have done.
“They are a credit to the borough and we are very grateful for their hard work and endeavour.”]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[AS the temperature takes a nose dive rough sleepers can take shelter - by spending the night in church.
All Saints’ in Edmonton is taking part in the Winter Night Shelter scheme to provide food and shelter for homeless people.
It is one of seven churches in Enfield operating a shelter that will run for thirteen weeks from January 4.
Parishioner and one of the two co-ordinators, David Bayton, said: “Last year was the first year we did it here and it was a real eye-opener.
“People were apprehensive about what it would involve.
“You tend to think the guests will be men in rags, who have drink problems, but they are people like you and me who have fallen on hard times, for whatever reason.
“We all became really close and by the end of the three months it was quite upsetting when it all came to an end.”
Rough sleepers have the option of going to a Crisis charity centre at Christmas, so the winter night shelter, in Church Street, begins in January, when many are back on the streets again.
Guests are referred by outside agencies – they can’t just turn up at the door – and must be drug and drink free when they are there.
The men and women are given a home cooked evening meal and then chat with volunteers before turning in for the night on inflatable beds with clean sheets. The next morning there’s breakfast -  luxuries they don’t get sleeping on the streets.
Fellow co-ordinator, Anne Marie Sanderson said: “There’s so much stigma involved with homeless people. But a lot of the people here last year had jobs and were really struggling to survive after being kicked out of their private rented accommodation.
“It makes you realise, it really can happen to anybody at any time.
“I have a support network and could move in with family or friends if I lost my house, but a lot of people don’t have that support.”
Guests are encouraged to save half their income, if they have jobs, while staying at the shelter and are helped by the Pilion Trust, an anti-poverty charity that tries to break the cycle and get them back on their feet.
Anne Marie added: “You can’t solve the problem, but by volunteering you are doing something tangible to help.
“A lot of the guests spend all day every day on the street and have nowhere to go.
“It must wear you down, never sleeping properly always watching your back. So this is a slice of normality, a chat if they want to, some food and somewhere safe to sleep.”
Volunteers are split half and half between people who are parishioners and those who aren’t.
They set up the beds, do the laundry, cook and spend time with guests and the night shelter need more of them.

        <text><![CDATA[Detectives have charged an Edmonton woman with fraud and conspiracy.
Police say the offences are alleged to have been committed in February and relate to the fraudulent obtaining of bank details by telephone from a vulnerable person, to gain access to the victim’s savings.
Reanne Morgan 18, of Dunnock Close, Edmonton, was charged with conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering.
A man from Clacton, Essex - Aseany Duncan, 19 - was charged with conspiracy to defraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and possession of articles for use in fraud.
Both Duncan and Morgan will appear on bail at Highbury Corner Magistrates’ Court on December 14.

        <text><![CDATA[A fire engine on its way to a suspected blaze at a block of flats blaze collided with a car in Edmonton in the early hours of this morning.
Nobody is thought to have been badly injured in the accident involving the appliance from Edmonton fire station in Church Street, which happened at 2.26 am at the junction of Fore Street, Edmonton, and the A406 North Circular Road.
Firefighters had been on route to reports of a fire alarm sounding in a block of flats in Northumberland Park, Tottenham.
The collision prevented the fire engine from responding to the call-out, but Edmonton’s second appliance did attend together with fire crews from Hornsey, Stoke Newington and Walthamstow fire stations, plus a fire rescue unit.
The incident at the flats was resolved by the crews and was over at 3.18 am,
The cause of the crash is being investigated.]]></text>

        <title>Road to the Olympic Games: Embarrassment of riches for Canadian sport</title>

        <text><![CDATA[In a year when a teenaged swimmer surfaced to capture the national imagination, Canada was bathed in a deep pool of sporting excellence.
While Penny Oleksiak won the Lou Marsh Award as Canada's athlete of the year for 2016, there were 10 other candidates who were worthy and contributed to what can only be considered a banner year for Canadian sport — maybe the best in recent memory.
Think of it — this country has the brightest star in swimming in Oleksiak, the next great sprinter in Andre De Grasse and the defining hockey player of his generation in Sidney Crosby.
But there is also a top-10 golfer in Brooke Henderson, third-ranked tennis player Milos Raonic and the Olympic high jump champion in Derek Drouin, who won gold with a stress fracture in his back.
Add Olympic gold-medallists Erica Wiebe (wrestling) and Rosie MacLennan (trampoline) as well as dominant para-swimmer Aurelie Rivard, who won three gold medals in Rio de Janeiro and set world records along the way.
We have not even mentioned baseball star Joey Votto or NBA basketball champion Tristan Thompson. Evan Dunfee, the Olympic race walker, merits a mention not only for his outstanding performance, but his steadfast adherence to the sanctity of honest and honourable competition.
There are just too many to mention.
Canadian athletes have demonstrated incredible prowess this year and for the selectors it was a difficult choice. Never, in my experience on the panel of voters for this award, has there been more to choose from.
It is proof positive that Canada is a sporting nation rich in a diversity of endeavour and talent.
In the end, there should be no dissent with regard to the recipient of this year's Lou Marsh Award.
Oleksiak is a strong female athlete who won four medals at the Olympic Games and became the Olympic champion in Olympic record time.
It is something never done before by any Canadian athlete at a single summer edition of the Games.
She also captured four medals at the recent world short-course championships.  Along the way, at the Olympic trials, at the Games themselves, and at the world championships, Oleksiak set 11 Canadian records, three world junior records and an Olympic record.
It is the greatest achievement in this sport in a single year by a Canadian.
And finally, at an Olympics where 16 of 22 Canadian medals were won by women, Oleksiak became an inspirational figure for young people in our country regardless of gender.
She became an iconic figure and without question deserves to be Canada's athlete of the year for 2016.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[OTTAWA – The chair of the House of Commons trade committee says he hopes Parliament can ratify the Canada-EU free trade deal this week before rising for the holiday break.
On Wednesday, the committee is set to begin clause-by-clause consideration of the bill that would implement the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, or CETA, said Liberal MP Mark Eyking.

The bill, supported by the Liberal majority and the Opposition Conservatives, passed second reading Tuesday — approval in principle, effectively — by a comfortable margin of 266 to 39.
“We’re moving fast on this one,” Eyking said. “If everything works well, we’re hoping to get it in the House before the break.”
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau talked trade during a telephone call earlier Tuesday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany is Europe’s biggest economy and the two leaders affirmed their support for the free trade deal, which both sides want to finalize next year.
Trudeau signed the deal with EU leaders in October, but not before a region of Belgium had to be cajoled out of using a constitutional veto that nearly torpedoed seven years of negotiations.
The European Parliament is expected to vote on the agreement in late January or early February.]]></text>

        <title>Nearly frozen puppy rescued from brink of death</title>

        <text><![CDATA[A five-week-old puppy that was found almost frozen in a northern Manitoba community Sunday made an extraordinary recovery.
“I’ve never seen a puppy recover after being that cold,” Manitoba Underdogs Rescue executive director Jessica Hansen told CTV Winnipeg.
Demi is a Husky Shepherd mix puppy. A local resident found her and gave her to the Rescue’s volunteers who happened to be feeding and picking up stray animals in the area, which reached temperatures between -16 and -23 degrees Sunday.
According to Manitoba Underdogs Rescue, Demi’s body heat was so low that it didn’t even register on a thermometer.
Demi was driven nearly three hours to Winnipeg for emergency veterinary care.
“I thought she was going to pass away in our arms on the drive to Winnipeg. She was nearly dead,” Hansen said.
“We snuggled her into the chest of one of our volunteers, wrapped her in heat packs, and put some corn syrup on her gums to try and increase her energy levels. She was just so tiny and helpless. It broke our hearts.”
Demi is currently in an incubator being monitored and kept warm at Winnipeg Animal Emergency Hospital.
Demi has tested negative for canine parvovirus, a highly contagious virus found in dogs, but Hansen expects the treatment she’s receiving to be expensive.
“We hope her health problems will end there, but we honestly aren't sure," Hansen said.
The rescue group also brought in several other dogs in recent days and hopes to be able to care for more as the temperatures drop.
But Hansen told CTV Winnipeg that they are restricted by their financial situation.
“We rely on donations from our generous supporters to allow us to help pups like Demi,” she said.
“We’re asking our donors to please remember Demi and Manitoba Underdogs Rescue this holiday season.”]]></text>

        <title>Sask. couple believes 'miracle' cat found on train is their pet</title>

        <text><![CDATA[A couple from Melville, Sask. believes the furry stowaway found on a train that travelled from Winnipeg to Edmonton on Sunday is their pet.
Retired CN workers Brent and Lynnette Hain believe the cat -- dubbed "Q-199" after the train it was found on -- is actually their cat "Tiger."
"I lined up the pictures that I had and the ones you guys had, and I put them side by side and you can tell they're pretty well identical," Brent told CTV Edmonton.
The Hains had heard the story of "Q-199," who was found during a routine safety check in Wainwright, Alta., by train conductor Brad Slater.
The feline may have been hidden under the engine deck for up to 12 hours in temperatures that plunged as low as -40 degrees Celsius.
"It's just meant to be, it's a miracle," Slater told CTV Edmonton on Monday about the cat's survival.
The Hains live on a farm roughly one kilometre away from the train tracks, and they believe their runaway feline hopped on from there.
The couple got in touch with Slater after seeing the story on their local CTV News station and shared pictures of Tiger with him.
"The name 'Tiger' he responds to. So I honestly think it’s their cat. As much as I don't want it to be, I think it is," Slater said.
Lynette Hains is planning to travel the same route her pet did on her way to Edmonton for the reunion.
Slater admits it will be hard parting with the cat he knows as "Q-199," but says he and his wife are planning on visiting the cat the Hains thought was a goner in Saskatchewan.]]></text>

        <title>Right turn on red? Montreal-area mayors say, give it green light</title>

        <text><![CDATA[A group of Montreal-area mayors are planning to appeal to the Quebec government to allow right turns at red lights on the island.
During a news conference on Tuesday the group of 15 mayors all mentioned needless waiting, wasting gas and higher air pollution as reasons to allow right turns on red lights.
Turning right on red lights became legal in Quebec in 2003, after a pilot project. At the time, the island of Montreal cited security and safety concerns for not joining the pilot project.
“We need to keep in mind that the island of Montreal, along with New York City, is the only region in Canada and the United States where it is prohibited to make a right turn on red,” Beaconsfield Mayor Georges Bourelle told reporters.
The mayors cited a CROP poll that found 73 per cent of Montreal residents and 71 per cent of demerged city residents were in favour of turning right on red. They also pointed to Ministry of Transportation numbers that show, in 2015, there were 361 road fatalities compared to 2,200 road fatalities in 1973.
Bourelle, Mount Royal Mayor Philippe Roy and Montreal East Mayor Robert Coutu all agreed that certain traffic lights should remain off limits, particularly some in downtown Montreal, but that more than half of the 2,587 traffic lights would be suitable for the change.
“In all other parts of Quebec, for 13 years, Ministry of Transportation statistics prove that Quebecers behave in exactly the same way as motorists everywhere else,” said Bourelle.
The City of Montreal recently adopted a Swedish road model policy, “Vision Zero,” to help eliminate fatalities and serious injuries due to traffic collisions. Part of the policy calls for not allowing right on red as a way to protect the most vulnerable.
“I think that we have to learn to live together before even thinking about doing that because we have some relationship and coexistence issues between pedestrians and drivers, bikes and trucks,” said Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre in a previous interview with CTV News.
Coderre also said, due to the requirement that cars leave a five-metre margin at intersections, to allow pedestrians to cross the street safely, allowing right on red “won’t happen.”]]></text>

        <title>Site C dam project forces expropriation of B.C. farm family this spring</title>

        <text><![CDATA[VICTORIA - The home of a family staunchly opposed to the Site C dam will be seized under British Columbia's Expropriation Act to make way for the controversial hydroelectric project, says BC Hydro's president and chief executive officer.
Jessica McDonald said Monday the terms of the expropriation mean Ken and Arlene Boon must be out of their home by May 31 to allow highway realignment work linked to the $8.8-billion megaproject to start early next year.
But McDonald said the agreement allows the family to continuing farming their land for two more years before they must leave the property. The agreement was not reached by consent but was signed last week by the Boons and the B.C. government.
"We were not able to come to a consensual agreement with the Boons and so we have acquired their property through expropriation," said McDonald at a Site C project briefing with reporters. "We have agreed with the Boons that they will remain in their home until the end of May and that they will have the rights and ability to continue farming the land for an additional two year period of time."
Site C will flood more than 5,500 hectares of land along the Peace River, creating an 83-kilometre-long reservoir and provide enough power to light up 400,000 homes. Project construction started in the summer of 2015 and is scheduled for completion in 2024.
The Boons are long-time farmers in northeastern B.C. and have fought the project in court. They could not be reached for comment.
An online petition to stop the dam includes photos of the Boons on their property.
Arlene Boon states in the petition that their farmhouse was built by her grandfather and "Hydro's plan is to flood our property and destroy it."
McDonald said the value of the Boon expropriation agreement will be subject to negotiations over the next year.
"It sets out that they have committed they won't physically interfere with the project in any way, not just on their lands," said McDonald.
Hydro recently reached consensual property agreements with six other landowners in the area to make room for the highway project. McDonald said Hydro also expropriated the home of another landowner, who had a rental property on his land.
Hydro officials also said about 30 homes in the Peace River Valley area near Fort St. John will be affected by the dam over the course of construction, but 20 of those can be moved to other locations within their property boundaries.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[A Regina teenager is facing an attempted murder charge after a woman was stabbed while she slept in her home, where police say the suspect lived as a renter.
Police were called to the home on the 200 block of Froom Crescent for a report of a break and enter in which a woman was injured.
When officers and paramedics arrived, they found a woman suffering from numerous stab wounds. The victim told police she was sleeping when she was awoken by a man, who stabbed her with a tool used in sheet metal work. The seriously injured woman was taken to hospital.
Investigators identified a male suspect, who police say was renting living space in the same home, and had fled the scene in his vehicle.
After searching for the suspect at several locations in Regina, police learned that RCMP in Manitoba had detained the suspect when his vehicle went off the road near the town of Virden.
Wesley Jettediah Brookes, 18, of Regina has been charged with attempted murder. He made his first appearance in Regina provincial court on Monday.]]></text>

        <title>After Aleppo Cease-Fire, Rebel and Civilian Pullout Delayed</title>

        <text><![CDATA[BEIRUT —  A cease-fire to evacuate rebel fighters and civilians from the remaining opposition-held neighborhoods of Aleppo unraveled on Wednesday, once again raising the specter of a bloody end to the battle for Syria's largest city as residents reported the resumption of shelling and brutal bombing runs.
Opponents of President Bashar Assad accused the government and its allies of scuttling the deal by adding new conditions, including the lifting of a rebel siege on two pro-government Shiite villages in nearby Idlib province.
However, hours after it crumbled, the rebels said the deal was back on. There was no comment from the government or its allies, and minutes after the new cease-fire was to take effect at 11:30 p.m. local time, there were still reports of shelling in the few blocks of the city under rebel control.
Three rebel spokesmen said the first group of wounded people and civilians were to be escorted out of the city early Thursday morning. Rebels would follow, they said, adding that the conditions had not changed and that they had even agreed with the Russians on the exact number of buses and convoys to be deployed in the rescue.
The Syrian military media denied an agreement had been reached and said in a statement that the negotiations were "complicated."
The evacuation was to have begun at dawn Wednesday, but quickly derailed, descending into terrifying violence. Residents said government buses arrived in the pre-dawn hours at agreed upon meeting points, where the wounded were first in line to be evacuated after surviving weeks of intense fighting amid destroyed medical facilities and depleted supplies.
But they were turned away by pro-government militias manning the checkpoints. Then violence erupted: shelling and then airstrikes. The rebels retaliated, at one point shelling the pro-government villages of Foua and Kfraya in Idlib and detonating a car bomb in a frontline area.
Residents, activists and medical staff described mayhem in the tiny sliver of Aleppo still under opposition control as volleys of shells rained down on the area where tens of thousands of civilians were trapped alongside rebels in gutted apartment buildings and other shelters.
Videos shared online by residents huddling indoors recorded the sounds of war — deafening explosions that highlighted fears of a bloodbath. Rescuers were overwhelmed and a comprehensive casualty toll was impossible.
"They began to strike as if there's no such thing as a cease-fire or civilian evacuation," said Mahmoud Raslan, a local media activist.
Mohammed Abu Jaafar, head of forensics in eastern Aleppo, said residents felt "duped."
"People have left their shelters .... to be ready for the evacuation. I can't describe it," Abu Jaafar said. "Since the morning, they started to target the areas where people have gathered. ... These people were walking to the crossings designated for exit."
The initial evacuation deal was mediated late Tuesday by Turkey and Russia as the rebel enclave rapidly dissolved, ceding more and more territory in the face of the brutal advance by Syrian forces, backed by Russia and Shiite militias from Lebanon, Iraq and Afghanistan. Along with Russia, Iran backs Assad's government and has committed advisers and elite Revolutionary Guard forces to the government side. Turkey backs some of the rebel groups fighting to topple Assad.
It was an effective surrender by the rebel fighters who had held onto nearly half of Aleppo for more than four years.
Rebel spokesman Bassam Haj Mustafa accused the Syrian government and Iran of foiling the deal by imposing new conditions on the rebels, including lifting the opposition's monthslong siege of the Shiite villages of Foua and Kfraya in Idlib province. Calling that an "excuse," he added: "They want a massacre and not concessions."
Osama Abo Zayd, a legal adviser for the rebels, said that in talks to salvage the deal, the rebels offered to evacuate the wounded in the two towns, but said that was another matter to be dealt with later, along with the future of two Sunni towns besieged by government forces. He said Russian pressure rescued the deal.
Rami Abdurrahman, the head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said the Syrian government and its allies also wanted the release of their fighters taken hostage by the rebels as well as the handover of over 250 wanted militant fighters.
"In exchange for this large numbers of evacuees, they want something in return," Abdurrahman said. He estimated there were 5,000 fighters still in the opposition enclave, as well more than 15,000 civilians. Tens of thousands have already fled to government areas.
Abo Zayd said Iran also demanded the return of the remains of Iranians killed in Aleppo.
Assad, speaking in a series of interviews with Russian media on Wednesday, said the cease-fire was designed to stop his government's advance in the city and "keep the terrorists and save them."
He said Western countries pressured Russia for the truce when rebels appeared to be on the verge of losing Aleppo. "Hostilities end only in the areas where terrorists say they are ready to surrender or leave," Assad said.
Asked if the Syrian army will move in on rebel-held territory in Idlib after taking Aleppo, he said Damascus would work out further military action with Moscow and Tehran after the government takes full control of Aleppo. "What city will be liberated next depends on where most terrorists receiving logistical assistance from abroad" are located, Assad said.
As the cease-fire collapsed early Wednesday, there was a flurry of diplomatic calls. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, spoke by telephone. Cavusoglu later spoke with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. Meanwhile, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin also spoke.
The surrender of Aleppo's remaining opposition-run neighborhoods to government control would be a turning point in Syria's civil war, allowing Assad control of most of the country's urban centers.
Mahmoud Bitar, a Syrian human rights activist based in Turkey who is in contact with those trapped, said some civilians set fire to their homes because they didn't want the militias to take them over.
"They thought they were going to get out, but the militias stopped the ambulances at the checkpoints. Now they have nowhere to stay because the area is overwhelmed with people."

        <text><![CDATA[Organizers of a London rally in support of the people caught in the brutal conflict in Aleppo thanked Canada for what it has done but called for more action.
More than 200 people attended the rally in Victoria Park Saturday, chanting "free Syria" and "stop the killing."
Many cars passing by honked in support of the flag waving crowd that included a cross section of people from youngsters to seniors.
Jamal Taleb, Imam of the Islamic Centre in London, said Canada's stand against the indiscriminate killing of civilians is appreciated.
"We just want Canada to take more action," Taleb said. "The issue is to stop the killing."
Wael Haddara, a London doctor and spokesperson for the organizers, said the London event was designed to show solidarity with the people that are suffering in the Syrian city.
Haddara said there are credible reports of widespread atrocities against citizens, men and boys being lined up and shot and women raped.
"Even though we recognize this is happening half a world away we are saying we are part of humanity. If we don't stand in solidarity with a part of humanity that is suffering then we lose part of our own humanity," Haddara said.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[London’s entrenched crystal meth crisis has prompted the city’s homeless coalition to launch a campaign next year educating the public, agencies and the government about the devastating drug.
“We want to help the general public understand we are in a crystal meth crisis and it has a huge impact on the individuals, on the services and on the general well-being of the community,” said Abe Oudshoorn, outgoing chair of the London Homeless Coalition.
“Not to oversimplify, but we can almost blame the one substance for how things feel in our city.”
The coalition is a collection of agencies and advocates involved with homelessness. Each year it sets priorities.
Crystal methamphetamine addiction began taking hold in London about two years ago, presenting a startlingly different face to addiction than other opioids.
Opioids are depressants that slow a person’s system. Crystal meth is a stimulant that speeds up the body’s central nervous system and over time causes violence, delusions, paranoia and hallucinations.
London’s homelessness programs are working, evident in a decrease in shelter visits and increase in people getting housing, Oudshoorn said.
But the perception in the public might be different, he said.
“When people talk about how downtown feels worse or places don’t feel safe, we want to help people to clearly understand that is the impact of one substance.”
The coalition wants to push the province to raise social assistance rates to help people find proper housing, Oudshoorn said.
Without access to proper housing, people are forced into unsafe and unhealthy housing that affects mental health and can encourage addictions, he said.
“It is such a fundamental gap between moving people from homelessness to housing, the financial side. There will be a call to raise the rates.”
Social service agencies have already had to change how they handle people addicted to crystal meth compared to people addicted to opioids, Oudshoorn noted.
City agencies that are part of the coalition are working on a drug plan for London, but will help share information while that plan is developed, Oudshoorn said.
In London, advocates say crystal meth use is much higher than the use of fentanyl and its toxic and more powerful variant known as carfentanil that are gaining attention outside the city.
St. Thomas police have confirmed one of the overdoses in that city the past two months was from carfentanil and warned first responders to be vigilant.
In a powdered form, carfentanil, 10,000 times more potent than morphine and about 100 times more potent than fentanyl, can be deadly if breathed in.
There haven’t been any seizures of carfentanil in London, said Const. Sandasha Bough, a spokesperson for London police.
Middlesex-London EMS reminded its crews this month to prepare for the deadly drug and wear masks if entering a suspected drug house.
“It is more of a precautionary measure. We haven’t any big influx of that yet,” said Jay Loosley, superintendent of education for Middlesex-London EMS. “But I’m sure it’s coming.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[A company Christmas party turned deadly early Sunday with a stabbing that killed a 26-year-old man and left a raft of others in custody, London police say.
Officers were called to an east-end venue, the Imperio Banquet Hall on Falcon Street, shortly after midnight in response to a disturbance. On arrival, police found the victim with stab wounds.
He was taken to hospital by paramedics where he was pronounced dead. No one else was injured in the incident, said London police Const. Kim Flett.
Several people at the scene were arrested and remained in police  custody as of Sunday morning.
The major crimes unit of London police took charge of the investigation and forensic identification officers were on scene as officers combed a snow-covered field next to the banquet hall parking lot.
The business, located in the middle of an industrial area just southwest of the Trafalgar Street-Clarke Road intersection, remained cordoned off by investigators late Sunday.
The Imperio website describes itself as a venue fit for a “wedding, family event, corporate or business function.”
Attempts to reach its owners were unsuccessful Sunday.
It’s unclear which business was holding its Christmas party there at the time of the stabbing. The victim’s name hasn’t yet been made public by police.
Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call London police at 519-661-5670 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477 or www.londoncrimestoppers.com.
This death marks the fourth homicide of 2016 in London and the first since September.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[DALLAS — Nick Burton is a self-proclaimed city boy, a businessman first and a farmer second. He's also an educator, a mentor and the kind of friend who wants others to succeed.
When someone is struggling with their business and needs some advice, people often say, "Oh, do you know Nick? You should really talk to Nick."
Burton, 39, runs Blue Collar Paris Victory Gardens in Paris, Texas, where he grows vegetables hydroponically and in soil. It used to be a nursery but now functions as the source of his subscription-based salad delivery business, Victory Lunch Club.
A New Mexico native, Burton moved to Texas in 2001. He started a lawn and landscaping business and grew from there. The "self-development junkie" said he became addicted to business coaching, which ranges from speaker training to technical expertise to image consulting.
"Whenever I got outside coaching, that's when my business took off," he said. "And whenever I couldn't afford it was when I needed it most."
Now, Burton's the coach. Earlier this year, he launched another business, a passion project called State of the Soil. The series of virtual seminars is designed to educate farmers on business and marketing tactics. Recordings of the webinars are available any time online for a fee, but live webinars are available for free a few times per year. As a farmer, Burton feels obligated to pass along where he has made mistakes and to give back to the agricultural community.
"Farmers are not used to having to pay for training because of the USDA and other programs," Burton said. "But with that, they are not getting great education, especially when it comes to the business side of things."
Farming, by nature, can be a solitary career choice -- and a calling for many -- that's full of trial and error and a lot of learning the hard way. Farmers are not used to networking or asking for help, and they're driven more by pride in their work than by market demands.
"I want to give people permission to tell their story, and sometimes, I have to give people permission to make a profit," Burton said. "But a lot of these are small family farms, and if they don't succeed, they are going to lose it all."
Burton is all about the tough love, however. He wants to help farmers build a community full of collaboration, innovation and support but only if they are willing. No whining allowed.
"When we didn't have good sales, I didn't blame the market, I blamed myself," he said. "Many people just grow what they like, but they have to grow what the market demands. It's not about the farmer; it's about the client."
Burton doesn't advocate one type of farming, even though there often is infighting and debate among farmers about topics such as hydroponics vs. soil.
"Whenever farmers say these things publicly, they are not helping each other out," he said. "Everyone is so passionate about what they do, but there's no one right way to do everything. Unless you're out there just spraying chemicals on everything, I don't have a problem with it."]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[GEORGETOWN, Ky. (WKYT) - Dr. Angela Maggard is an Obstetrician-Gynecologist at Pikeville Medical Women's Care Center. Dr. Maggard is currently in France on what was supposed to be a family trip. Things took a frightening turn on Thursday.
A gunman opened fire on police on Paris' iconic Champs-Elysees boulevard Thursday night. The attack left one officer dead and three people wounded before police shot and killed the attacker. Dr. Maggard was on Champs-Elysees boulevard and witnessed the attack.
"I saw him move it and when he did that, I could see it was a machine gun, and that's when we knew it was a terrorist event. It was an attack," Dr. Maggard described.
Her husband, John Finney said, "He started shooting bullets in the air, and police were in the street. It was a very terrifying moment."
The couple's daughter, Maranda Finney, is in school at Georgetown College. Finney says at first her parents weren't able to provide a lot of details about what was going on, only that they were alive and ok.  She spent the next few hours searching online, trying to find any information she could.
"You don't think it's going to happen to you," Finney said. "I was like it's not going to happen to us. I know it's happened before and everyone thinks that it's not gonna happen. I still can't even fathom."
Finney says she would have been on that trip if not for finals coming up at Georgetown.
Finney's parents and siblings are visiting other cities in Europe as well. They had plans to leave Paris on Saturday. The will return to Kentucky next week.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - United Airlines has apologized to a French woman after she wound up on a plane to San Francisco instead of Paris from a New Jersey airport.
WABC-TV reports ( http://7ny.tv/2pX53Gh ) Lucie Bahetoukilae was scheduled to fly from Newark to Paris last month. Bahetoukilae, who only speaks French, ended up in San Francisco after boarding a plane at the gate that corresponded with her ticket.
Bahetoukilae's niece, Diane Miantsoko, says United made a last-minute gate change that her aunt missed. Miantsoko says United staffers scanned her aunt's ticket and seated her in an open seat anyway.
She eventually made it to Paris after an 11-hour layover in San Francisco and 28 hours of travel.
United says it apologized "for this unacceptable experience," and that it's working to prevent it from happening again.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[PLYMOUTH CO. - A suspect in an early February farm auction theft near Hinton has been apprehended.
On Feb. 4, The Plymouth County Sheriff's Office investigated a theft of approximately $7,000 worth of farm equipment from a farm auction near Hinton.
On April 25, the Plymouth County Sheriff's Office received information about a similar auction theft in Paris, Illinois.
The suspect was identified as Paul Block Jr., 49, of Waterloo.
Deputies from the Black Hawk County Sheriff's Office and the LaFayette County, Wisconsin, Sheriff's Office conducted a search warrant at Block's residence outside of Waterloo and located thousands of dollars worth of stolen property.
The officers spent seven days searching and identifying stolen property from two Illinois locations, two Wisconsin locations, four Minnesota locations, and six Iowa locations, including Allamakee County, Dallas County and Plymouth County.
All but one item has been recovered from the theft near Hinton. Block will be charged by Black Hawk County with possession of stolen property in reference to the Plymouth County theft case. Block is being held at the Black Hawk County jail for first degree theft, a Class C Felony, and second degree theft, a Class D Felony.
Block's bond was set at $25,000, cash only.
He is also being held on a no bond detainer out of Wisconsin.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[PARIS, Mo. — In 1999, Lynn and Bob Fodge were looking to move their farming operation from Indiana, where both were born and raised. Their oldest son was interested in raising cattle, and if the Fodges were going to expand their operation, they needed to relocate.
“Bobby, our oldest son, is a cattleman, has been since the day he was born,” Lynn Fodge says. “In Indiana, there just wasn’t room to expand there.”
The family considered locations across the massive middle swath of the country.
“We looked from mid-Ohio to the western borders of Montana and Wyoming,” Fodge says.
The family ended up picking a spot in Monroe County in northeast Missouri. In the last few years, Missouri has ranked second or third in number of beef cows, occasionally switching spots with Oklahoma and ranking only behind Texas. Fodge said Missouri had a lot to offer for them as a place to raise cattle.
“There was a big enough piece to do what we wanted,” she says. “… It’s good here. There is a lot of marginal ground here that until two years ago hadn’t been put into crops.”
Fodge says it’s competitive for pasture, but their forages and crops meet their needs.
The family calls their farm Hopewell Farms, and they grow row crops and Angus beef cattle. They farm with Bobby and his wife, Patty, their younger son, Alec, and his wife, Annie. Some members of the family are more into cattle, and some are more into the row crops, but they all pitch in and help where it’s needed.
Fodge says they are the fourth largest Angus breeder in Missouri, and on a recent early May day, black cattle dotted the lush green grass in the pastures fanning out from the farm office. The white boards on the wall helped keep track of who was coming to pick up cattle. Periodically, the phone rang with customers calling.
They sell their Angus cattle to customers all over Missouri and out of state as well. Fodge enjoys working with these people, building relationships with the repeat customers.
“I suppose the interactions with our customers would be the thing that is the best for me,” she says.
As for the decision to relocate to Missouri, the Show-Me State offers a lot of benefits for beef cattle production, University of Missouri Extension ag specialist Valerie Tate says. It starts with good forage production.
“I think forages are one of the main reasons why Missouri is a beef cattle state,” she says. “We have the opportunity to provide grazing for a big part of the year.”
Tate, based in Linn County in north central Missouri, says producers can stockpile forage toward the end of the year to cut into hay feeding days.
Also, Missouri has a lot of highly erodible land that can be dedicated to pasture, Tate says, and a good marketing structure.
“Our landscape and our topography are well suited to growing forages,” she says.
“…We also have good access to livestock markets.”
Of course, Fodge knows the challenges of raising cattle as well, the endless fixing and building of fence, combatting cold winters or dry summers, having to alter plans when the cattle are in need.
The cattle business is tougher than it used to be, she says. Margins are tight and producers have to work more than ever to reach out to people who don’t have personal experience with farming and livestock production.
But Fodge and her family have found Missouri to be a good spot to raise their cattle and enjoy the way of life.
“It’s still a way of life, it’s still what we want to do,” she says. “You fight your battles that you have to fight.”]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[HOLLIDAY, Mo. — A 25-year-old Paris, Missouri, man was arrested Friday on DWI and other charges after a crash that led to a serious injury, reported the Missouri State Highway Patrol.
Kody R. Berrey was arrested just before 11 p.m. on May 5 in Monroe County on charges of felony DWI linked to serious injury to another person, leaving the scene of a motor vehicle accident, and careless and imprudent driving. He was held in Marion County on a 24-hour hold.
The Highway Patrol reported that a 2008 Ford F-250 Berry was driving southbound traveled off the west side of Route C around two miles south of Holliday, Missouri, and started to skid. The vehicle then crossed back over the road and overturned several times at nearly 8 p.m on Friday. Kody Berrey and his passenger, Scott L. Berrey, 31, of Paris, were ejected from the vehicle, according to the Highway Patrol.
Scott Berrey reportedly received serious injuries and was taken by Air Evac to University Hospital in Columbia, Missouri. Kody Berrey had minor injuries and refused treatment, the Highway Patrol reported.
The vehicle was reportedly totaled and towed from the scene. The Monroe County Sheriff's Office assisted the Highway Patrol at the scene of the crash.

        <text><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (RNS) Evangelical leaders are praising President Trump for pressing for the release of American pastor Andrew Brunson during Trump’s meeting this week with the Turkish president.
“This shows the clear and open lines of communication between evangelicals and this White House,” said Johnnie Moore, an author and advocate for persecuted Christians.
Brunson, a North Carolina native, has been detained in Turkey since October.
“Not only were we able to make the President and Vice President aware that this was a priority of ours, we were pleased that they shared our concern and acted upon it,” said Moore, author of “Defying ISIS: Preserving Christianity in the Place of Its Birth and in Your Own Backyard,” in a statement to RNS.
The White House stated that Trump on Tuesday (May 16), in a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, “asked that the Turkish Government expeditiously return him to the United States.”
Officials in Turkey, which is 99 percent Muslim, have cracked down on opponents and perceived opponents — including some American Protestants — since a failed July coup.
A minister of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church, Brunson was originally detained in the coastal town of Izmir, where he had lived for two decades, and was later transferred to a prison. The American Center for Law and Justice, a conservative Christian law firm working for Brunson’s release, said he has been falsely charged with “membership in an armed terrorist organization.”
The Turkish president reiterated Tuesday that he believes that organization, identified by Turkish media as a network of U.S.-based Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, was involved in the attempted coup. Gulen has rejected those claims.
A Turkish Protestant official said there is no connection between Brunson and the organization, Slate reported.
Jay Sekulow, chief counsel of the ACLJ, discussed Brunson’s case with Trump at a White House meeting days before the president’s meeting with Erdogan.
He called the White House’s attention to the case “a major sign of significant progress toward bringing Pastor Andrew home.”
The European Centre for Law and Justice, a partner of the ACLJ, previously petitioned the United Nations to intervene for the pastor, saying Turkey was violating its constitution and the U.N. Charter.
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met with Brunson’s wife in March when he visited the Turkish capital of Ankara, and a State Department spokesman said in April it had called on Turkey to “resolve his case in a timely and fair manner.”]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[The South African grapefruit season is about to start for VerDi Import. "We expect the first arrivals of Star Ruby next week. The grapefruit arrives on an empty market, because Spain and Turkey finish the season this week, and the Florida season also ends earlier," says Conrad Rijnhout.
VerDi receives the first grapefruit from Maswiri Farm from Bonaire, followed by Limpopo and Eastern Cape. "Quality is looking good. Because of a better harvest, we expect slightly more volume than last year. The majority of the volume will consist of sizes 45/50. From week 19, they'll start packing the White Marsh variety," Conrad continues.
According to Conrad, South Africa increasingly spreads its volumes over more and more markets, and especially the Asian market is becoming larger for South Africa. For VerDi, the most important markets are the Netherlands, Scandinavia and Eastern and Southern Europe. "The consumption of grapefruit remains stable in any case, and even appears to be recovering again somewhat."]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[The global energy shortage, which is particularly  threatening to South Africa, makes it imperative to apply and operate the most  energy-efficient smelter technology, says metallurgical plant and machine construction company SMS Siemag.
Over the years, the group has developed several measures to reduce the overall energy consumption of metal and slag production lines.
“And, with ongoing innovation and adaptation, we are convinced that significant additional  energy reduction can be achieved in the future,” says SMS Siemag submerged-arc furnaces and electric smelters GM Rolf Degel.
Submerged-arc furnaces and electric smelters form an essential part of the production line, especially in the ferro- alloy, silicon metal and non- ferrous metal processes. Most of these electric furnaces are highly  energy intensive, with the metallurgical process consuming the bulk of electricity.
Energy consumption is mainly determined by the smelting process implemented, and is also influenced by the design of the furnace, notes smelter design and construction company Metix MD Reinier Meyjes. SMS Siemag owns a majority share of Metix.
The production of  silicon metal and iron silicon requires the highest specific energy consumption. The electrical energy required to operate a sili- con metal furnace is between  11 000 kWh and 13 500 kWh.
Meanwhile, iron-nickel units consume between 5 500 kWh and 8 000 kWh of energy for every ton of iron nickel produced,  depending on the minerals and nickel content of the product.
Energy Reduction Measures
The measures the SMS group has developed to reduce the overall energy consumption of smelting technology include the application of energy recovery systems, such as the solution SMS Siemag installed for Turkey’s sole high-carbon ferrochrome producer, Eti Krom.
“In semiopen-type electric smelters, the combustible gas that is generated during the process is fully combusted in the freeboard below the furnace roof. The furnaces are equipped with adjustable doors, which allow precise control of the offgas temperature. Depending on the process, the temperature is controlled at between 550 °C and 750 °C,”  explains Degel.
A boiler produces 30 t/h of  superheated steam, which is converted into 5 MW of electrical power by a generator. Eti Krom calculated the amortisation  period of the installation at three-and-a-half years.
This system increases the  financial feasibility of processes with higher offgas generation capacity, such as silicon metal furnaces. Internal calculation shows that about 20% of the input electric power of a furnace can be recovered.
Meanwhile, a closed-type furnace produces carbon oxide-rich gas, which can be used as an  energy source in various up- and downstream processes.
“A few companies have  installed electric power generators driven by gas turbines or reciprocating engines. However, this requires intensive cleaning of the furnace gas. The SMS group can offer a ‘dirty gas’-combustion boiler system, which combusts the raw, hot carbon oxide-rich gas directly in a boiler. Up to 15% of a furnace’s electricity  requirements can be recovered with this solution,” says Degel.
Electricity Efficiency Improvement
The design and material used for the electrode current lines and the roof design of a furnace also influence its overall energy efficiency.
The SMS group improved the high-current line system by  finite element analysis, as well as financial return calculations. By increasing the copper area in the high-current line system, as well as using forged copper contact shoes, the overall electricity consumption of these parts is reduced.
Furnace transformers with low copper losses are specified and placed as close as possible to the electrodes to shorten conductor lengths, while simultaneously reducing the reactance of the complete system.
Advanced Cooling Concepts
Limiting the amount of heat lost by furnaces, using a balanced cooling or refractory system, also reduces energy consumption.
“All furnaces require cooling for parts that are exposed, or  potentially exposed, to high temperatures. Heat absorbed by this cooling system is normally not economically recoverable.
“The SMS group believes a balance must be struck by using the cooling system to protect the equipment under harsh conditions, while refractories reduce heat uptake under normal conditions. Refractory linings are specifically designed keeping this principle in mind,” notes Meyjes.
For four 72 MW dc ferrochrome furnaces, currently  under construction at chrome producer Kazchrome’s chrome project, in Kazakhstan, a new roof cooling system was developed to lower the overall energy consumption by more than 5%, compared with other dc smelters.
Further, the SMS group offers special cooling arrangements  designed especially for large- capacity iron-nickel and platinum furnaces, which involves copper plates being inserted into the sidewall.
“This cooling arrangement is successfully operating in the group’s largest rectangular-shaped furnaces at projects owned by miners Anglo American, in two 114 MVA iron- nickel furnaces, and Vale, in two  120 MVA  iron- nickel furnaces, in Brazil, as well as French multi- national mining and metallurgy company Eramet, in New Caledonia, in two 99 MVA iron-nickel furnaces,” Degel adds.
This cooling system extracts less energy when compared to cooling elements such as waffle coolers or copper staves.
“The system is a superior  solution in terms of furnace  integrity, cooling rate, maintenance and safety, as all water passages are kept outside the furnace, eliminating the risk of explosions.
“In case of cooling water being interrupted, there are also no break-out risks. It uses an easy refractory concept (the use of standard bricks) in comparison with other systems.  This is easily installed and cheaper in comparison with other systems and is used in numerous furnaces,” says Degel.
Reduce Process Steps
Reducing the number of process steps by eliminating agglomeration and sintering also promotes energy efficiency.
The need for costly, energy-intensive furnace feed preparation is eliminated by dc smelting technology, which enables direct charging of fine-feed materials  to the furnace. This process principle has been extensively applied in ferrochrome production in Kazakhstan and South Africa.
Meanwhile, SMS Siemag says the four 72 MW furnaces supplied to Kazchrome, which should be commissioned in 2012, represent a new benchmark in  dc furnace technology.
“The client chose this furnace type as it enables the direct use of ore fines, dust and low-grade  reductants and eliminates coke as a reductant. It also offers a higher  chrome-recovery rate of more than 92%, eliminates agglomer-ation, sintering and preheating and enables the use of fewer process steps and equipment, which makes operation easier and  improves the overall plant availability.  “Operating costs are also significantly reduced, which complements Kazchrome’s aim to be the lowest-cost ferrochrome producer worldwide,” adds Degel.
Combining dc furnaces with an efficient energy recovery system lowers energy consumption, taking into account all the carbon energy requirements of conventional ac smelting routes.
The advantages, compared with conventional dc furnaces, enable an energy efficient  operation and maximum furnace availability.
“A patented, reliable long-life electrode column enables slipping (electrode lengthening) under full power, while maximum power-on time prolongs furnace life and improves furnace and off-gas control. Further, unique  in-house knowledge decreases arc deflection, a high-speed thyristor  ignition controller improves and stabilises energy consumption and an innovative cooling or  refractory concept reduces heat loss,” explains Meyjes.
Process Optimisation
Through process optimisation, metal yield is increased and  recovery rates are improved, while reducing energy consumption.
Submerged-arc furnaces are also applied to deplete metal from slag, mainly in the nonferrous industry. SMS Siemag developed a continuous operating rectangular furnace, which ensures a better recovery rate compared with circular-shaped furnaces.
The group commissioned this furnace at mining company  Mopani Copper Mines, in Zambia.  A metallic content significantly  below 0.6% in the discharged slag is being achieved.
The results of this unit convinced integrated zinc producer Kazzinc to install the same process at its operation, in Ust-Kamenogorsk, Kazakhstan.
The Mopani mine’s furnace has a transformer connection of 11 MVA, while Kazzinc’s unit has a 12 MVA transformer.
Maximised Power-On Time
Heat and electrical losses are reduced when furnaces operate at constant nominal load and when the furnace’s metallurgical conditions, including the raw material mix, are kept constant, says Degel.
“Furnace interruptions have a significant negative impact on energy consumption, owing to the additional energy required to heat up the furnace and to  restabilise the process. The SMS design assures the highest availability levels. Many of the units operate for several years with availability close to 100%,” he concludes.]]></text>

        <title>Former MI6 spy known to U.S. agencies is author of reports on Trump in Russia</title>

        <text><![CDATA[WASHINGTON Christopher Steele, who wrote reports on compromising material Russian operatives allegedly had collected on U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, is a former officer in Britain's Secret Intelligence Service, according to people familiar with his career.
Former British intelligence officials said Steele spent years under diplomatic cover working for the agency, also known as MI6, in Russia and Paris and at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London.
After he left the spy service, Steele supplied the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation with information on corruption at FIFA, international soccer's governing body.
It was his work on corruption in international soccer that lent credence to his reporting on Trump's entanglements in Russia, U.S. officials said on Wednesday.
Emails seen by Reuters indicate that, in the summer of 2010, members of a New York-based FBI squad assigned to investigate "Eurasian Organized Crime" met Steele in London to discuss allegations of possible corruption in FIFA, the Zurich, Switzerland-based body that also organizes the World Cup tournament.
People familiar with Steele's activities said his London-based company, Orbis Business Intelligence, was hired by the Football Association (FA), England's domestic soccer governing body, to investigate FIFA. At the time, the FA was hoping to host the 2018 or 2022 World Cups. British corporate records show that Orbis was formed in March 2009.
Amid a swirl of corruption allegations, the 2018 World Cup was awarded to Moscow and Qatar was chosen to host the 2022 competition.
The FBI squad whose members met Steele subsequently opened a major investigation into alleged soccer corruption that led to dozens of U.S. indictments, including those of prominent international soccer officials.
Senior FIFA officials, including long-time president Sepp Blatter, were forced to resign.

SHIFTING GEARS
Steele was initially hired by FusionGPS, a Washington-based political research firm, to investigate Trump on behalf of unidentified Republicans who wanted to stop Trump's bid for the party's nomination. The BBC said on Wednesday, "He (Steele) was compiling this report on behalf of initially Trump's opponent Jeb Bush," referring to one of Trump's 16 opponents in the 2016 Republican primary.
The BBC subsequently said on Thursday that its correspondent misspoke.
Bush's spokeswoman, Kristy Campbell, denied any involvement between Bush and Steele.
"It is absolutely not true that Governor Bush had any knowledge or involvement with this gentleman and his allegations," Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell told Reuters by phone. "It’s nothing we’ve ever seen before."
Steele was kept on assignment by FusionGPS after Trump won the nomination and his information was circulated to Democratic Party figures and members of the media.
Steele's dealings with the FBI on Trump, initially with the senior agent who had started the FIFA probe and then moved to a post in Europe, began in July. However, Steele cut off contact with the FBI about a month before the Nov. 8 election because he was frustrated by the bureau's slow progress.
The FBI opened preliminary investigations into Trump and his entourage's dealings with Russians that were based in part on Steele's reports, according to people familiar with the inquiries.
However, they said the bureau shifted into low gear in the weeks before the election to avoid interfering in the vote. They said Steele grew frustrated and stopped dealing with the FBI after concluding it was not seriously investigating the material he had provided.
Steele's reports circulated for months among major media outlets, including Reuters, but neither the news organizations nor U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies have been able to corroborate them.
BuzzFeed published some of Steele's reports about Trump on its website on Tuesday, but the President-elect and his aides later said the reports were false. Russian authorities also dismissed them.
Associates of Steele said on Wednesday he was unavailable for comment. Christopher Burrows, a director and co-founder of Orbis with Steele, told The Wall Street Journal, which first published Steele's name, that he could not confirm or deny that Steele's company had produced the reports on Trump.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[LOUISVILLE, KY--(Marketwire - December 23, 2010) -  (NYSE Amex: NLP) -- NTS Realty Holdings Limited Partnership (the "Company") announced today that it completed the acquisition of a multifamily property located in Sanford, Florida (near Orlando, Florida in Seminole County), commonly known as Plantation Lakes Apartments (the "Property"). The Property is a 362-unit luxury apartment complex located on 31.62 acres offering garden style units that feature large floor plans, private entry units, 9 and 10 foot ceilings, direct access garages and detached garages. In addition, the property offers its residents access to a clubhouse with a business center, fitness center, swimming pool, sundeck, and an indoor basketball court.
On December 3, 2010, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire the Property. On December 9, 2010, the Company formed LE Central Holdings, LLC ("LE Central"), a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and LE Central formed Lakes Edge Apartments, LLC ("Lakes Edge"), a Delaware limited liability company wholly owned by LE Central. Lakes Edge purchased the Property from CORAC, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company not affiliated with the Company. LE Central will serve as the sole manager of Lakes Edge. Lakes Edge has appointed NTS Management Company, an affiliate of the Company, as the property manager for the Property. The Company intends to market the Property as "Lakes Edge Apartments" on a going forward basis.
The Company paid a purchase price of $37.075 million to acquire the Property. A spokesperson for the Company indicated that the Company satisfied the purchase price with funds obtained from a $24.5 million short-term mortgage loan from PNC Bank, National Association, from working capital and from proceeds from the Company's sale in June, 2010 of its Sears office building. The spokesperson also indicated that the transaction was being conducted pursuant to an Exchange Agreement with a qualified intermediary as a transaction under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code which is intended to allow the Company to defer the payment of income tax on any taxable gain related to the sale of its Sears office building.
Brian Lavin, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company's managing general partner said, "We are very pleased to add this Property to our portfolio of multifamily properties. We believe that this Property will enhance our growing presence in the Orlando area and will permit us to further leverage the expertise of our management team in the Orlando area apartment market."

        <text><![CDATA[BEIJING -- At least 141 people are missing after heavy rain triggered a landslide in south-western China, local authorities have said.
A rescue mission was underway after approximately 40 homes were buried in Maoxian county in Sichuan province, the Xinhua news agency reported.
The landslide hit the village of Xinmo at around 6 am (2200 GMT Friday) and blocked a 2-kilometre section of a river, according to Xinhua.
Pictures from the scene, shared by the People's Daily newspaper group on Twitter, showed emergency responders walking among large mounds of rubble.
China's president Xi Jinping on Saturday said rescue workers should do all they can to reach people buried by the landslides and minimize casualties.
The landslide occurred in a hilly area of Sichuan, inhabited by Tibetans and another minority group, the Qiang people.
A day earlier, two villagers died while four others were injured in Puge county of Sichuan province, also after rain-triggered landslides, Xinhua reported.
China has been experiencing weeks of heavy summer rains that have caused extensive flooding and triggered landslides.
In central China's Hunan and Hubei provinces, flooding has affected at least 390,000 people this week, Xinhua said, adding that 9,000 people have been evacuated.
In some areas there was over 160 millimetres of rainfall in just one day. In the Hunan city of Yueyang, 47 reservoirs reportedly overflowed.
Heavy rain is forecast to continue in Hunan over the next few days.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[BEIJING --At least two people died and 55 others were injured on Friday in a gas explosion at a noodle restaurant in eastern China, state media reported.
Among those hurt, 12 had sustained serious injuries, Xinhua news agency reported.
The blast took place at around 8:40 a.m. (0040 GMT) at a noodle restaurant in a popular area of Hangzhou, a scenic city in Zhejiang province. Videos of the explosion published by state media show billowing flames and thick, grey smoke enveloping a building.
The flames and the heat shattered the glass of passing vehicles, including a bus, which was what caused most of the injuries, Xinhua reported.
The fire had been put out, authorities said.
Gas explosions and workplace accidents are common in China, where safety regulations are often loosely enforced.
It also comes just a few days after a gas explosion at a curry restaurant in Taichung left one person dead and over a dozen injured.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Two people were killed and at least nine injured in a knife attack at a Walmart in southern China, state media agency Xinhua said Monday.
The attack, made using a kitchen knife, occurred around 9 p.m. Sunday at a store in Shenzhen.
A 30-year-old man surnamed Jiang has been arrested over the incident.
Xinhua said the man was currently unemployed but had left his home of Chongqing in southwest China in 2014 to become a migrant worker.
His family said they lost contact with him the following year and that the man had mental illness. Police said he was lucid during questioning.
Sunday's killings were the latest in a series of knife attacks in the country.
Experts say that China's poor mental health system and continuing taboos about receiving treatment for such conditions contribute to such incidents.
In May, a stabbing spree in Guizhou province left two dead and 18 injured. In January, Just in January, a man stabbed 11 students to death at a kindergarten in Guangxi province.
China's tight control of firearms is often cited as one reason for the high prevalence of knife attacks in particular.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Starbucks is to take full ownership of all its China outlets, after agreeing to buying out its joint venture partner for $1.3bn (£994m).
The deal will see it acquire the 50% stake it does not already hold in 1,300 stores in Shanghai and the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang.
Starbucks already fully owns the other 1,500 outlets in China - its fastest-growing market outside of the US.
The coffee giant said the buyout was its biggest ever acquisition.
The announcement came as Seattle-based Starbucks announced net income fell 8.3% to $691.6m for the three months to July - only just matching market expectations.

The company also announced plans to close all 379 of its Teavana stores by the middle of next year because they had been "persistently underperforming".
Starbucks bought the tea brand for $620m in 2012, and plans to continue carrying the products in its main Starbucks stores.
Starbucks shares fell 5.5% to $56.24 in after-hours trading.
Chinese dreams
The latest results are the first under new chief executive Kevin Johnson, who took over from co-founder Howard Schulz in December.
Mr Johnson described the China buyout as part of the firm's "long game" to deal with cooling growth in the US.

The world's largest coffee chain is being affected by a reduced footfall in America's malls and high streets, as more consumers turn to shopping online or buying from meal kit sellers and convenience stores.
Same-store sales in the US rose by 5% last quarter. In China, there was 7% growth.
License deal
Starbucks already has a presence in 130 Chinese cities and hopes to expand its 2,800 stores to more than 5,000 outlets by 2021.
There are nearly 600 stores in Shanghai alone, the largest number of any city globally.
Meanwhile, Starbucks said it was offloading its 50% stake in all 410 outlets in Taiwan, meaning they will be fully owned by its joint venture partners. who pay the US firm license fees.
The firm made a similar move with its Hong Kong and Macau operations in 2011.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Two strong earthquakes have struck north-western Iran, leaving at least 180 people dead and more than 1,300 injured, officials say.
The quakes struck near Tabriz and Ahar, but most of the casualties are thought to be in outlying villages.
Six villages were destroyed, and thousands are spending the night in emergency shelters or in the open.
Another 60 villages sustained more than 50% damage, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Reports say phone lines to many villages have been cut off, making rescue efforts harder.
The US Geological Service measured the quakes at magnitude 6.4 and 6.3.
The first tremor occured at 16:53 local time (12:23 GMT), according to state TV.
"The quake has created huge panic among the people," one resident of Tabriz told the BBC. "Everyone has rushed to the streets and the sirens of ambulances are everywhere."
The towns of Haris and Varzaqan in East Azerbaijan province were among those that suffered casualties, Khalil Saei, local crisis committee chief, told state TV, according to the Associated Press.
'My family is terrified'
Dozens of rescue workers have been sent to the region, but relief efforts have been limited overnight. Phone communication in the city of Tabriz has also been disrupted, reports say.
An Iranian Red Crescent official estimated that 16,000 people have been given emergency shelter after they were forced to leave their homes.
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's office posted a statement on its website expressing condolences to those in the disaster zone and calling on authorities to "mobilise all efforts to help the affected populations," the AFP news agency reports.
A provincial official has warned people in the region to stay outdoors overnight because of the risk of aftershocks.
"My family is really terrified. It is night time now but we cannot sleep," Tabriz resident Amina Zia told the BBC.
"This earthquake was... very strong and violent.
"There were around 10 aftershocks, which lasted a total of 10 minutes."
The two earthquakes came within minutes of each other, according to seismology experts at Tehran University.
Iran straddles a major geological fault like, making it prone to seismic activity. In 2003 an earthquake in the city of Bam left 25,000 people dead.]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[LONDON (Reuters) - An explosion in a supermarket in the southern city of Shiraz injured 37 people and may have been caused by a gas leak, Iranian state media reported on Saturday.
The blast occurred at 12.45 a.m. (2115 GMT) in the city's Hypermarket center, the reports said.
The head of fire department in Shiraz, Mohammad Farokhzadeh, told state television that a gas leak or an explosion of flammable items stored in the supermarket could be the cause. He said an investigation was underway.
None of those injured was in critical condition, the head of the medical emergency center of Fars Province was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA.
The explosion was loud enough to be heard in most neighborhoods of Shiraz, the official news agency IRNA reported, adding that walls of the supermarket had collapsed.
Videos published on social media showed fire had reached the second storey of the building which is partly residential. Windows were shattered in shops and buildings on the street.]]></text>

        <title>Aspiring student from Enfield selected for China internship</title>

        <text><![CDATA[An aspiring 23-year-old graduate from Edmonton will be jetting off to China after securing a two-month internship to gain international experience at a finance company.
Amber Sinclair-Alexander has studied a joint honours in French, accounting and finance at Aberystwyth University, in Wales, for two years, and spent her third year in the South of France.
Amber of Felixstowe Road, Edmonton, will fly out to Shanghai next month where she will gain vital experience at an asset management firm.
“This is an amazing opportunity,” she said. “As a joint honours student, it can be tricky to gain equal experience in both subject areas as they are both quite different.”
The Generation UK internship programme is funded through The British Council which provides placements and academic scholarships to UK students in China.
As an intern Amber will attend conferences, phone clients, assist managers with day to day tasks and have the chance to pitch ideas to help build the company.
She will also learn Mandarin which is spoken by over a billion people in China and will be a impressive skill to show prospective employees when she applies to be a chartered accountant.
“It will be a culture shock at first,” explained Amber who will be provided with hotel accommodation during her stay.
She will explore the city’s famous landmarks on day trips with other interns.
Amber spent her third year of university as a teaching assistant in Perpignan, south of France, teaching English to French students and will graduate next week at a special ceremony.
She speaks fluent French which she said will be useful on her placement as it is spoken by colleagues at the firm as well as English.
Amber said she was “shocked” when she found out she had been selected for the internship.
“I was grateful when I found out that there were only six people chosen,” she added.
Professor Jo Crotty, director of the Institute of Business and Law at Aberystwyth University said: “Amber’s feat in securing the Generation UK internship is testimony to the success of this strategy.
“We know that she will make good use of this opportunity and act as worthy ambassador for the department and the university.”]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[AN Edmonton man who carried out a “vicious assault” on a woman he knew leaving her with multiple stab wounds has been jailed for 10 years.
The 49-year-old victim was stabbed a number of times by Taleh Habibzade who called the police after the attack in Seaton Street, Edmonton, at 3.20pm, on Friday, February 3,
The victim was taken to an east London hospital and has since been discharged.
Habibzade was arrested at the scene on suspicion of attempted murder and was charged the following day.
The 48-year-old, of Colton Way, was jailed for 10 after he was found guilty of attempted murder, at Wood Green Crown Court, last Friday (July 21).)
Detective Sergeant Darrensing Bheekoo, from Enfield Borough, said: "Habibzade launched a vicious assault on his victim. She has recovered from her injuries but the memory of that day will always remain with her.
"Habibzade is beginning a lengthy prison sentence and will have time to reflect on his actions."]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[PRIMARY school youngsters put their culinary skills to the test in a dragon’s den-style competition in Edmonton as part of a healthy eating project aimed at tackling obesity.
Eight schools pitched their food and drink creations to judges at Millfield Theatre, in Silver Street, Edmonton, after taking part in the Cooking Enterprise Project over the summer term.
Paul Everitt, Enfield Council’s head of arts and culture was on the judging panel on Thursday (July 13) along with Emma Rigby, founder of Facebook community group Love Your Doorstep.
First prize was awarded to pupils from Cuckoo Hall Academy, in Cuckoo Hall Lane, who impressed judges with their healthy snack bar.
Runners up were the crunchy munchy team at Galliard primary, in Galliard Road, who made a healthy oat bar.
A fresh Greek salad and a tropical juice sensation won first place in the mini master chef competition created by Raynham Primary pupils, from Raynham Avenue.
Youngsters were educated about healthy food through workshops and were encouraged to use fresh fruit and vegetables in their meals.
After creating their own healthy food and drinks they sold them at their schools with the aim of making a profit.
The project was organised by The Edmonton Community Partnership and run by Kinder Kitchen which provides educational workshops about making healthy food choices.
“The children and teachers enjoy taking part in such a fun initiative,” said Renee Flourentzou, Edmonton Schools Partnership Manager. “It’s a great way to learn about healthy cooking and business at the same time.”]]></text>
